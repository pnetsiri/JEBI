    "TV arrived quickly and was easy to set up. Great price as well.",

    "Great t.v. Absolutely awesome! The remote will be in the trash as soon as I find a decent remote app. Completely trash. Touch one button, any button in my case the volume button, it takes you out of whatever app you're currently in and directly to Samsung T.V. which I don't watch.Tired, worked all day, wanted to watch 5 mins of Golden Girls and got kicked out 3x.Seriously, fire them. I'm afraid to try to turn the volume up now. Crap just touched it again and now I'm watching Supermarket Sweep.FIRE THEM!!! WORST REMOTE DESIGN IN THE HISTORY OF T.V.",

    "No recomiendo este televisorAl inicio el televisor se ve muy bien, tiene excelente imagen, color, peso. Ideal para disfrutar de alguna pelicula en buena calidad.Sin embargo despues de un año de uso empieza a mostrar la mitad de la pantalla oscura lo cual se va incrementando con el paso de los dias.El problema con mi televisor no es nuevo, es algo que viene sucediendo a muchas personas que han comprado este modelo de televisor y en este tamaño, al parecer es algo que ya Samsung ha detectado pero no acepta.Para empeorar el costo de arreglo puede ser hasta el costo del articulo de modo que si quiere comprar un televisor para tirarlo a la basura en un año, pues compre este lindo televisor Samsung",

    "If this wouldn’t be such a hassle I would return it! It’s SO slow switching between things. And this remote SUCKS! It is SO touchy. The slightest bump and it changes what you were watching or turns off. The only good thing is the nice big screen size.",

    "After 5 months, not working",

    "Went through all the self troubleshooting steps and finally called support. Still no picture. Was told I have to wait 48 hours for a tech to contact me and its coming up on Easter weekend.  Not at all pleased with the customer service. Asked for a replacement and was told no.  I will no longer purchase Samsung and am shutting amazon account over a $350 TV.  I work too hard for my money!!",

    "The tv itself looks great on the wall. Slim and sleek with a great 4k picture for the price. Samsungs newest version of tizen has been nothing but problems for me. Probably once a month the tv will freeze and I must unplug to reset the software. Lots of features that I don’t want or need that can’t be uninstalled such as Samsungs proprietary gaming and internet tv apps. My ps4 is connected through hdmi and turns on randomly which subsequently exits whichever streaming app I’m currently using and forces me into Samsungs proprietary gaming app. It’s frustrating. The entire smart tv UI feels like a desperate attempt to sell me on features and services that I never wanted or asked for. I’ve been a fan of samsung tvs for years because of their simplicity, reliability and picture quality, but this new software really misses the mark. Would steer clear unless you’re absolutely dead set on a Samsung tv and don’t mind useless apps on your tv that constantly pop up to interrupt whatever your doing.",

    "It's a year and a half old and the screen split in 2, the right side is much darker than the left. It's a nightmare to connect to a receiver and surround sound system and if you disconnect it you have to do a factory reset so it will forget the receiver or it won't connect. Spend a little more and buy a Sony.",

    "Too many issues experienced in first 3 months",

    "We bought this TV 14 months ago and a couple of days ago it turned off on its own while we were watching. When I turned it back on it started to flash on and off and now half the screen is blacked out. It seems that part of the LED is not working (according to good ‘ol internet) which is a common issue with Samsung LED and OLED TVs.",

    "This tv is a huge disappointment. It can’t ever connect to the “matching” Samsung sound bar. I had to buy a Roku for Pandora to work. This is a known issue that Samsung cares not to fix. I’m buying an entirely new setup and putting this garbage on marketplace hoping someone is dumb enough to make the same mistake I did. Do not buy unless you like banging your head in frustration.",

    "The remit is about worthless using buttons for multiple purposes is nothing short of a of a pain in the ass the volume button is the mute button also? What crap. But we have to make remotes smaller and smaller until they are gone.",

    "Absolutely love this TV.  Great picture quality, great sound without sound bar.  Pairs well with Roku. Easy setup.  Highly recommend due to high quality of this product.  You can’t go wrong with this midrange priced television.",

    "This TV has an excellent, clear picture.  The remote is simple.  The smart features are convenient.  My wife and I watch a lot of hockey games in bed on this TV.  It provides high refresh rates which lead to an outstanding picture when watching sports.",

    "Bought this TV in November 2021.  The performance and picture quality was great.  The Amazon team did a great job with the delivery, unpacking, and placement of the TV.  For the price this is a good UHD 4K TV.  Three months after the 1 year manufacture warranty expired the right side led backlight strip went out.  Samsung customer was helpful to try and remote fix the issue but at the end they referred me to a local TV repair company in my city.  Declined the home service at their quote was $180 to drive 11 miles to my house, charge $120 for labor, and whatever the parts would cost + tax.  Going to take the TV to a local repair shop and save $$$.  Get the extended warranty.  For what we paid this should have lasted so much longer before service/repairs were needed.",

    "Tv up one month after paying off its don't buy",

    "TV arrived on time.  It is light weight,  so it was easy to hang.  Has a lot of neat features that enhance your viewing experience.",

    "I purchased this TV to replace an aging Vizio. I researched many different brands and traveled to several brick-and-mortar stores shopping for a new TV. My research finished up with two TVs on my list. This Samsung 8 model and the TCL ULED. The TCL was a bit cheaper but I worried that being not a brand name, I would find it hard to get it repaired if needed.We received our new Samsung early and it was nicely packaged and easy to set up. Once we turned it on and it finished its updating of the software, I could not believe my eyes. The picture is crisp and clear, and the colors are great. The refresh rate allows me to watch sports without any of the nagging traces some TVs have on fast-moving objects.I could write a book about the great quality this TV has but I want to keep it short and not bore anyone with my amazement. If you are looking for a TV in the mid-range I HIGHLY recommend this model of Samsung.",

    "TV is good for what it is, but it's very laggy. When switching from sources or in between apps, it lags a lot. Slow to process stuff and delayed response to controller.",

    "Se craqueo la pantalla después de dos mesesNecesito q me ayuden para ver si lo arreglan. Gracias o cambian",

    "Purchased this TV as a Christmas gift and unfortunately there is a black area in the screen that won't go away. I've always ordered Samsung and had never had an issue this is a bummer!",

    "I don’t know how or why you’d make such an expensive TV with such a terrible remote. It lags and skips, you have to press many times to get it to accept feedback.Don’t even get me started on the voice portion.",

    "Excelente equipoEl equipo funciona excelentemente y la calidad de imagen es muy buena",

    "Very bad remote, not good sound quality, bad menu, shockingly horrible speed and voice control. For its price it is absolutely horrible, would say it’s more worth ~$200",

    "Product delivered did not even power up. One week for a replacement, two weeks to haul the original to the junk yard, it will be taking the place of my car in the garage until then. Original delivery was 2 days. Could not be more disappointed. Never buying electronics from Amazon again.",

    "Terrible navigation",

    "Great picture. Remote could have more features but I'm sure they're in there somewhere and I just haven't found them yet.",

    "It freezes up several times and doesn’t start working again until I unplug it and plug it back in I took a few videos of it but amazon doesn’t allow more than a video",

    "Lags super hard, also an issue with volume. Gradually as I watched a show I found myself having to turn it up to 60 but when I turned it down to 10 before I turned it off the volume was at a totally normal level the next day. It’s just overall a very glitchy tv. Have had it less than 3 month and it’s outside of the return window so not much I can do about it now.",

    "I have been purchasing Samsung TV's since 2003.  Their picture and sound have always been far superior to other brands.  I purchased this TV for a guest bedroom.  I wanted to stay with Samsung, but didn't want to spend alot of money as this TV as it wouldn't be used too much.  The TV is good for the price, you probably won't find one better at this price point.  Picture quality and tone are on the dark/dull side.  You'll have to manually adjust display to see any darker filmed programming.  Remote took some time to get used to (features, profile and buttons were odd-feeling at first) and the battery compartment lid slides off very easily.",

    "Love the TV and easy installation",

    "This fits perfectly in our bedroom and provides the best quality picture. We always shop Samsung and will purchase any other TV brand.",

    "I was excited to get this TV but I've only had it for 3 weeks now and it's frozen up 4 times already. Not happy at all. It will be much hassle to send it back or replace it due to its size.",

    "The picture isn't great, the screen is very wavy, the apps are INCREDIBLY SLOW even with 400+ Mbps wifi, and the remote control is god awful. That's the biggest reason I decided to write this review, the remote control. Every time you go to pick it up, it turns the TV off. It's so sensitive. If you have the remote sitting down and you bump it with your finger it will turn your TV off, or change the channel. All in all, this was a bad purchase. I love my 65 Samsung, so I know it's not the brand. It's this specific TV, it's just bad.",

    "You CANNOT add your own APP's into this TV. Don't know why they say it is a smart tv === IT IS NOT A SMART TV. the remote I replaced Quickly bought an after market conventanl one. The remote that comes with this TV is a piece of garbage. Picture is great. And the volume is good. Sad but I do not like this tv as it has too many short commings. I do not reccomend this TV.",

    "Really disappointed about this tv. It was fine the first two months and now it freezes like twice a day where we have to reset the whole tv. Really annoying.",

    "I’ve tried every troubleshooting recommendation. Adjusted brightness (duh), contrast, gamma, everything. There’s no solution - you get what you pay for.To all of the people saying “some shows are just dark”, stop.Fortunately I bought these TV’s for my Airbnb, otherwise I would be furious. Don’t buy this TV.",

    "DO NOT BUY!!!This tv was great for 18 months. Then one day we turned it on and the picture was obscured with dark shadows. Samsung said there is nothing they can do about it because the warranty is only seven months. You would think you could count on a $1200 TV working for more than 18 months and that in the “rare” case that it didn’t that the company would makeThings right. Nope. But a little research online shows we are not the only ones dealing with this problem. A lot of Samsung TVs are having this issue just 2-3 years after purchase. Very disappointing. Both the product and the customer service. We will not be purchasing Samsung for our next TV.",

    "Tv was laggy during some fast motion, but the worst part was white spots that appeared on the screen that got worse and worse. Became so noticeable that I had to return the tv. Spots appeared after only a few months of owning. Do not buy this tv.",

    "Loved the picture- clear, bright and sharp.  Remote and streaming-app home screen took a bit of learning.  The built in speakers are the absolute worst.  Think IBM 5160.  Think Realistic brand 1970s handheld transistor radio.  Yup.  THAT BAD.  So, if you're going to get this, make sure to budget for a soundbar or other kind of system.",

    "Love the picture quality and that it can connect to all my accessories pretty seamlessly. I just wish it still had a/v port so I didn’t have to purchase a different blue ray/dvd player",

    "Likes everything about it",

    "Had it for 16 months.  Back lighting stopped working. Unfortunately it's out of warranty and will cost money to fix. I have other brands of TVs that lasted and are still working after 10 years. I am done with Samsung. DO NOT BUY IT !",

    "very good picture quality, intelligent connecting to everything almost automatically, easy to set up, decent sound but I want a sound bar or theater speaks, many apps, good connection to wifi,  lots of value for the money.",

    "I love the sleek design, the features, and this is a replacement for the 7000 series I had broken, so I replaced with the same TV except, this is the Q8000 series and there is a markedly different picture and ease of use.",

    "I received this TV on January 28th and it turned off in the middle of a show on March 8th and won't come back on.  I have exhausted all troubleshooting guides and still no luck.  The TV won't turn back on.  Amazon won't replace it because it broke 9 days after the refund timeframe.  Ridiculous.  DO NOT RECOMMEND and very disappointed with Amazon.",

    "Great tv for the money. Good picture and color quality.",

    "Sound blanks.  Have to turn it on and off to reset. Do not buy this TV.  You could never trust it and guests complain.  I actually hate it",

    "Good merchandise!!Su imagen y calidad del producto",

    "My previous Samsung TV, which was great, had 5.1 audio via the optical port to my 5.1 audio-capable receiver.  The sound was excellent.  That TV blew a fuse, or something.  I bought this TV for its 3 HDMI inputs, which I need.  But there is no 5.1 audio out on this TV.  Under Settings>Sound>Expert Settings when I try to set Pass-Through it says, The current audio format cannot be passed through with an ARC....  What's up with that?  Don't buy this TV if you want 5.1 audio.",

    "Samsung has a great tv line up.  Only recommend a sound bar or external speaker as the built in ones don’t provide a good listening experience.",

    "Love the picture but the sound sucks! I max it on 100% mostly. I will be buying a surround sound system to hopefully rectify the problem. Also the TV just is so dang complicated for me. I just want it to work. Less hoops please!",

    "Tv SamsungExcelente inversion, todo excelente me encanta... Excepto por la ultima foto que se le ve como una abertura en la pinta de la esquina derecha del tv que no sé si es que viene asi de fabrica o si vino dañado en esa parte pero todo funciona perfecto.. pensé en devolverlo por esa abertura que se ve. Pero como dije anteriormente no sé si es un error de fabrica o si es normal asi, o si fue que vino dañado.",

    "Great colors and clarity for the picture. Remote was a bit too complicated with options",

    "If the remote was any smaller, you couldn't have but one button on it.No user guide. Way over priced.",

    "Really like this product. I use it in my living room and love the clarity of the picture!",

    "First of all, the delivery drivers damaged the TV before arrival so I had to go through this horribly bad return process where I had to reseal the whole tv and use duct tape. The reason it was damaged beforehand was because the foam protecting it inside was horribly insufficient and the drivers were not careful, secondly I had to reseal using duct tape because the only thing holding the whole thing together was two plastic strips beforehand, what were they thinking? UPS refused to pick it up in fact because of how badly it was held together, so I had to reseal using duct tape and PAY for it myself to have them pick it up.I ended up going to Best Buy to buy the exact same TV and boy, this was a dumb TV. It took forever to setup because the features through the app simply don't work, so I wasted all that time and had to re-do it using the remote. Secondly the software on the Samsung TV is very bad and it tries to be so smart that it's cumbersome, difficult to switch inputs, and if you don't do anything on the TV for 30 seconds it switches stuff around. Who designs products like this? Also, the picture in the end was very subpar, almost worse than my very inexpensive tv at many points. Also not to mention that the TV I had from Best Buy also had the bezels falling off of it. Really bad TV, software, hardware, and shipping, and quite disappointed in Amazon returns.",

    "Exelente resolucion de lampantalla me encanto",

    "I have stopped on page 15 or 20 of my initial setup on this TV to write this review. So far there have been multiple user agreement pages, each with numerous terms of service files that you must sign off on to use most functions. Then there are other needless impositions such as creating a samsung account, tying it to your mobile device, giving them my zip code (I’m already connected to my ISP), creating a PIN for some reason, and who knows what else before I can finally just use the TV. I don’t care how good the TV performs, samsung has really went out of their way to make setup an inconvenient and invasive experience",

    "First of all, I have other Samsung TVs which I’m very pleased with.  However this particular TV has backlight design issues. The picture quality looks foggy, and one must raise the brightness settings in order to compensate for the fog.  The backlight bleeds through around the edges when you have the lights off watching a movie.  It’s understood it does not have true black in the background, however there is entirely too much bleed through. The sound is not great either. It’s not worth $500 bucks. My assessment, the fair cost for this product is $249.  Positive note, Samsung still uses a great user friendly interface to access settings, channels, apps, etc.",

    "All my TV's are SAMSUNG!Beautiful colors, 85 just the right size for my living room!Really makes movies look so much better!",

    "Es excelenteMe agrado todo buen televisor",

    "Great picture and the Alexa voice command control is a hoot!  On top of everything it arrived today TWO days earlier than expected by UPS.  Wow.  Warning:  this is not plug and play.  Lot's of setup involved requiring a cell phone.",

    "The tv is okay i was hoping that it was a little bit louder than what it is. Meaning it’s not very loud even with the tv on 100",

    "This tv doesn't work on most apps you have very few choices to watch. They require you to give all your personal information before you can watch the few things on it. I SAY AGAIN DO NOT BUY THIS TV THEY SUCK",

    "When TVs go bad, they just go bad. I only buy Samsung TVs & I’ve only had one other TV go bad but after years of use. When the TV did  work, it was beautiful. While I appreciate the ease of return of the TV, I was annoyed that they didn’t send a replacement.",

    "This tv was used for less than 10 hours before a dead pixel appeared on the screen. It creates a large horizontal line that is very noticeable. Contacted Samsung the manufacturer and they told me there is nothing they can do. I was told I would need to purchase another one. Never purchasing a Samsung tv again.",

    "The TV had some minor issues earlier but now has gone completely dark on one side. Only normal, in fact less than normal use and this has happened. Worst part is Amazon wasn’t helpful at all. Waste of money. Not buying any electronics from Amazon again.",

    "This tv was to replace another 4k tv that stopped turnign on and workign after a year. Now this one, after 1 DAMN YEAR - stopped working will not turn on, will not factory reset,  main button nor via remote (remote conekd out last month, had to use another Samsung remote.I often use the tv only at night and in ECO mode, and it can't even last a damn year!!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "They market this device as a smart TV that will just do everything for you.  All is does for you is to install a bunch of unwanted bloatware apps that I don't want or need.This TV often fails to detect my PS5, to the point where the PS5 turns off because it doesn't think the TV is on.  It's suppose to do this automatically. The wizard for setting up a source is super aggressive and takes over immediately if something is not detected.  To make this problem worse, the remote does not have a input button.  You know, that button that has come standard on every TV since like 2000.  Nope Samsung wants to make their remote tiny for some reason so now you have to go to Options, then move up to input selector then use right a left to select the source.Typically I have to turn my PS5 on/off a few times for the TV to detect it putting the PS5 in standby mode make this even worse.",

    "We destroyed both our TVs moving across the country and had to get a new one! The price point is great and the quality is amazing! We love all the new features this new generation has!",

    "I have macular degeneration and we were looking for a TV with a very clear picture and large so that I might be able to enjoy TV still. This is a great buy and a great TV All of our devices synced up right away with it. We'll use a Roku sound bar with it and it works great.",

    "Very easy to use all of the features are great",

    "Bought two, one of the remotes is just broken, have to press buttons 4-5 times to get anything to change. Don't flip though the channels or scroll netflix without waiting a few seconds or the tv will freeze and have to be unplugged. 2.5 months later and I've hooked my old tv back up and put this junk in the guest room",

    "Awesome",

    "The sound output is absolute garbage. The picture looked way better at the store. I'm really disappointed in this one. Samsung should be ashamed themselves for putting this one out. Don't waste your time on this one.",

    "Total piece of excrement, less than 90 days old and the picture went to hell. Complete waste of money DO NOT BUY!",

    "Love Samsung products",

    "I can't believe it only lasted me 1yr 1 months. Purchased in December 2021 and most up in January 2023. I am disappointed I have owned samsung everything in my home. Right now I own 3 samsung tvs 4 samsung androids  etc. Can it be that I just had bad luck wit this tv. It's a lot of money  $1700 to throw away. I have np money to pay samsung to fix it. Keson learned always get warranty",

    "I’ve had this tv for about a year now and it is horrible. From the useless and slow responding remote, to the inability to stream Hulu or other networks. The tv goes through cycles of wanting to work and not, but a large portion of the time I just turn it off and walk away because it won’t stream. I don’t have cable and thought this would be good with built in apps and I was sorely mistaken. Safe yourself a headache and go with a non Samsung tv!",

    "We love the TV it is perfect and a great value!",

    "Well it took several days before I got help to hang the tv on the wall. Hung it up and watched it for one show. Next day I left for vacation. Returned and finally was going to bing watch some tv on this massive tv.About 6 hours later the tv started to turn on and off on its own with no picture. Yep it broke. Spent the next 2 hours on chat with Samsung.Aftet re doing everything the website said to do with the Samsung guy it was determined it was a faulty board and needs to be repaired.Funny this is a common issue they know about but you know just cross their fingers and hope they work.So what i have is an 85 boat anchor on the wall that they are going to send someone out to repair. So basically i paid full price for a soon to be referbished tv that more than likely wont last very long.I would recommend not to purchase any Samsung TVS. They know they have issues but just ship them out anyway hoping they work past the warranty.",

    "Muy bueno el tamaño es el que  yo queria y la marcaMe Encanto y la Marca super buena",

    "Nice tv",

    "The picture quality seems fine, but I got this TV to replace a 10 year old TV mostly because that TV took so long to load a streaming apps.  I’m shocked this TV is even slower. Trying to switch between YouTube and any other streaming service and I’m waiting at least 2-3 minutes each time. I wish I had spent a little bit more money and purchased a better TV..",

    "I’m so frustrated. For years I had no complaints but these past few years stink.OOPS!  Failed to remove screen protector (embarrassed much).",

    "i had some issued with the first one i order reporting as delivered, when it was not. after sorting that out, i reordered it and since setting it up ive absolutely loved it. perfect for wall mounting as its extremely thin and very light. my only gripe with it is the upper left corner has a patch that is a little brighter, particularly noticable with dark colors., blacks or greys. its not too bad though, just a little annoying.",

    "Bought two of these, one of them started boot looping after a year.",

    "Very nice tv with a nice picture and very good features. A good value too. But the remote is not user friendly at all. It’s very difficult to use the remote.",

    "Love the big screen still trying to figure the volume out but great buy",

    "Absolutely a flat TV, 2021 model 50 inch, sleek design, stunning color second to none! Besides, free Samsung streaming channels came as a complete surprise, major news outlets, sports, movies, more than I would ever watch! The simplest remote control ever. One caveat is that I have to manually set the volume and keep it there. Another thing, loading program directory is unreliable when network is busy. Other than that, what an upgrade, I had been watching one news channel with my old Sanyo using an antenna.",

    "Tv SamsungMe agrado bastante, muy buen producto!",

    "The television is great, but the controller is very difficult to use.  I would NOT buy another Samsung television if they haven’t improved the controller..",

    "Very good an acts as a heater in winter also. Puts out a lot of heat",

    "Picture quality not good at allI want to return this item but when Amazon delivered and unpacked it, they took the box, so now to return it they ask for the box! Seems like a scam to me!",

    "Used as monitor in our office to display information for the office",

    "Clear pictures",

    "I love this TV.",

    "Great picture. Delivery was great.",

    "I’m happy that I invested in this product. The remote easy to handle and even has voice recognition.",

    "Technology is great and picture is outstanding.  But I will never buy another Samsung TV again.  Packed full of bloatware and sponsored content on home page with no way to configure.  When powering up a streaming service begins to play and I can't reconfigure to do nothing.  So frustrating.  Installed Roku device and bypassed the smart TV altogether.  But I shouldn't have to do that",

    "Had to return it. Severe backlight bleed in dark rooms. Sound was pretty subpar as well. Guess you get what you pay for",

    "Initially I was very pleased with the picture and features. Set-up was easy and the picture is fantastic. Unfortunately, when I turned it on today, it has a blue line running vertically through the screen. The time period for returns has passed, so I’ll see what Samsung can do, but I’m not hopeful.",

    "This is the second time I’ve tried out a Samsung TV, the first time I had to return the TV because it became unresponsive (1 week after purchase). Same case with this model. It completely stopped working and won’t even turn on less than 3 months after purchasing. The picture is beautiful but this technical issue is a serious flaw in their design. Samsung support is ok, but they outsource their technical support, so you don’t know who you’re going to get. Their contracted IT partners also take over a week to make an appointment, not to mention, they require that you take the TV down if mounted - even explaining that I work full time and don’t have support to take it down myself, did not sway support. To say I am dissatisfied with the quality of this TV and the level of support is an understatement. I highly recommend staying away from Samsung TVs or maybe opt for a different model, dealers choice.",

    "High picture quality. Very happy with this TV.",

    "Bought this 65” TV in November, 2021 and picture quality has gotten worse over few months. As you can see, the left is brighter than the right side. $800 down to the drain!",

    "Requires better directions and 2 people to fully use",

    "Watch sports.",

    "Easy set up. Great sound, very good picture.",

    "It’s almost like motion is too fast for this tv. This will be the last tv I buy online.Also, the screen turns black sometimes and I have to unplug and plug back in to turn on.",

    "Lo recomiendoMuy buen producto, el delivery fue excelente entraron lo abrieron para asegurar que todo venia bien, gracias. Lo recomiendo",

    "It’s been working perfectly and is so easy to use!!!",

    "Love this ! Amazing sound amazing tv for the price amazing picture",

    "worst tv remote ever.  confusing, some functions don't work, not lit, doesn't jump ahead or fast forward.  worst tv ever",

    "It's a very big tv..quality is good",

    "The TV arrived in good condition.  It has oddly low volume, but we purchased a sound bar.Literally the day after out return expiration day the remote stopped changing channels.  We changed batteries, we reset, we moved anything we could see as a block in front, we even purchased a new Samsung remote and both have the same issue...it WONT CHANGE CHANNELS.  It does everything else...it allows for streaming apps, it records, etc.It won't even allow for punching in the channels.Long story short.  Don't buy this TVIt's now becoming a very expensive gaming monitor",

    "Great picture. Easy setup. Thanks",

    "There’s nothing I dislike about this Samsung 43” Smart TV. Beautiful picture and the remote is easy to navigate.",

    "Amazing tv picture is unbelieveable so clear  i love it.",

    "We just love how clean and how beautiful the picture quality is! Easy to set up everything!",

    "I absolutely love the television so does my husband nice pictures and great for the price no complaints here.",

    "Samsung does not support this tv. They do not explain that. In less than 3 months, we were numerous versions behind on the software and unable to use any apps.After spending time chatting with their support team, their only suggestion was to download an offline software update to a USB and plug in into the TV. This will be a never ending cycle as they will not auto update the software.Save yourself the headache!",

    "Used in the living room of our Beach House, a weekly rental property in the OBX. TV is bright, clear easy to navigate and price is great. Arrived  in 2 days in great condition, packed very well. Instructions for set up were a little confusing at first, all drawings, no words. Most importantly: lay the TV on a table not the floor so that the stands can be installed perpendicular to the face, just as it shows in the images.",

    "It was great at first. We are now at 1 year and 2 months from buying it. The picture started going out today. See pic. We called to see if we could get it fixed. We’re out of our warranty. Go figure. So we were trying to watch it as is, only for the whole screen to go black. Won't buy Samsung again. Wasted money. Will begoing back to Vizio. Never had an issue with those. FYI, I looked online to see if there was anything I could do to fix it. Turns out there are a LOT of Samsung tvs having the same issue. Save your money.",

    "Absolute horrible UI. Huge (on the order of seconds) lag between pressing a button on the remote and an action registering. Screen casting to the TV from devices is such a bad experience - it works 50% of the time and takes an eternity.TLDR: they should’ve put in a better CPU in this TV bc the user experience is horrible a real “dumb” TV",

    "First the pluses.  A phenomenal picture.  It almost looked three dimensional.  Slim design.  Lightweight.  Easy to assemble.The negatives.  The software did not function properly.  Samsung support was not able to fix it remotely.  Sometimes the self-repair options were not available.  It did not download apps.  What use is a smart TV if it does not download apps?The remote is very difficult in several respects.  It is totally non-intuitive.  The writing on it is so small that anyone over 50 years of ago will have trouble reading it.  We could not figure out how to operate the volume control until we found an independent video on Youtube.And finally, there were no directions that came with the television on how to use its feature.  You figure with a purchase of nearly $500 there would be a competent manual.As with some other televisions, the space in which to insert the cable and the HDMI is extremely tight and difficult to visualize.Due to the software problems, we sent it back.",

    "I really love this tv.  Got it to go on the wall in the bedroom, and the 55 is perfect for our space.  The picture is of course fantastic for a 4K Samsung.  The smart hub is nice.  It must have updated because after a few months, it added a Games hub to the screen.  Now it uses the Media hub for all the apps, and I have to switch to the Games tab to go to the HDMI source the Xbox is plugged into.  That's slightly annoying as it defaults to the media tab and takes a few seconds to get over to the Games tab and switch over and find Xbox.What makes the tv awesome though, on top of the picture quality and apps, is the built-in Bluetooth.  I love being able to connect to a soundbar without running cables.  I love being able to connect to my Bluetooth headphones at night after the wife goes to sleep so I'm not disturbing her with loud bangs from action scenes, and can still hear the low dialogue from talking scenes.  It's the feature I never knew I needed in a tv.The sound is OK.  Super loud if you're next to the tv, but it doesn't 'bounce' off the backwall and get super loud in front.  So you have to turn the volume up pretty high in order to hear it from in front of the tv, which makes it WAY loud if you're to the side of it.  I'd recommend a soundbar.  Honestly, that's really every tv I've ever owned though.  I don't take much off the score for audio anymore.  It just is what it is.",

    "I bought 4k expecting a better picture than 1080 HD but have to avoid 4k because i cant tell whats on the screen.  The remote is tough to use.  The TV turns itself back on a minute after i turn it off.  Save your money until they fix the technology and provide a picture worthy of 4k.",

    "I love that this is THINNER than the older TV sets ... and that it is SMART.  Smarter than I am!",

    "This is an upgrade for me, not because my 10yr old samsung died (put that one in a bedroom, still works great, great picture) but wanted an updated version with blue tooth capability for my Bose sound bar.  the updated picture is great too!",

    "Great product for the price.",

    "Love this tv! Quality is great! Price is great!",

    "First ever product review, I believe.  We like the TV.  However, a couple of times in the past months it wouldn't connect to the internet.  Restarted modem and it worked again.  This week, 4 weeks past the warranty expiration, the TV stopped completely.  When the TV is on and trying to connect, all other household internet connected devices stop connecting.  3 other TVs, multiple computers, cell phones, Alexa, Ring doorbell, Blink cams, etc. all stop working when the TV is turned on.  TV off, everything works again.1 hour with online support and was told it's either an ISP problem (I'm guessing the ISP will laugh if I tell them all other devices connect fine except the Samsung TV, but it's an ISP problem), or I need an in home, non-warranty, service call.At this point, I'm considering it a total loss.  I have many Samsung devices, but very much not impressed with the Samsung TV.  Will make a replacement purchase but it won't be a Samsung.",

    "The remote is bad. But the TV has a really good picture. I use a sound bar so can't comment on the sound.",

    "this tv is super slow and has really bad connecting issues with air play",

    "Perfect replacement, excellent quality. Sound bar might enhance the total package.",

    "Outstanding purchase!",

    "Very happy with this purchase. Great TV, great features.",

    "This TV is such a beautiful picture and sound. The sound bar is also good with it the built-in Alexa comes in handy, this TV is such a beautiful picture and sound. The sound bar is also good with it the built-in Alexa comes in handy, very easy to program and set up.",

    "Does the job but the tv itself, not the apps or connect, but navigating the smart tv menu and switching between apps is very slow. For example, to use the voice feature to switch between apps, it says it’s connect for a good 10 seconds before it’s ready to go. Not ideal but it’s already mounted to my wall.",

    "Only had it 3 months and just keeps getting slower. Keeps locking up and I have to disconnect the power to get it to work again. When I 1st got it the game input source was on the main page but they put out a update and moved the game source onto another page full of game advertisements. I have to make about 8 clicks on the remote to go from tv to game input and there isn't a input source button on the remote at all. I will never buy another tv from them again",

    "Nearly all our tvs in our house are Samsungs and as expected the interface and picture quality is great.  I'm assuming the sound quality is just average due to fact that this tv is so thin.",

    "This TV overheated and half the screen went dark not even two years into owning it.Would not recommend, save your money",

    "Excellent product.",

    "This a beautiful TV. You will need 2 people to certainly get it to where you need it to be. Easy to set up and this TV connects to everything like a charm. Plug in anything and it recognizes everything. A plus if you have a Samsung phone as your cell phone instantly connects with your TV. So far this is the best TV in the house, just so happens to be the largest. At 85 inches.",

    "The TV is great compared to its price. The delivery was also very good.",

    "Seemed to have issues with Netflix. Too many steps to set sleep timers and volume complicated.",

    "I love this tv but not the remote. Still trying to figure out the remote. I may get a Universal remote. The TV has a place to program that remote. I have the tv mounted on my wall and love it. Soon, I will either figure out the remote or purchase another.",

    "Good",

    "ExcelenteDIVINOOOOLO RECOMIENDO",

    "Enjoyed its picture and features but only worked for only TWO YEARS wow.......make sure that you grt the additional warranty YOU WILL NEED IT",

    "This is a great tv. I honestly didn't think all the fuss about picture quality mattered until I got this TV. Really clear pictures... you can see detail i know I've never seen on tv... Easy to use remote, too...really happy with my purchase.",

    "We decided to cancel cable and start streaming. We needed a smart tv for the bedroom and this is perfect. Very easy to set up, even for us old people!",

    "perfect for the mancave!!",

    "didn't keep the TV but had one several years ago, i will buy it when my current TV goes bad",

    "I got this TV which is a really nice tv, but I don’t understand why after a while it goes mute and there’s no sound, then I have to go back and forth a few times to the channel that I’m current watching to make the sounds comes back, very disappointed",

    "Clear and crisp picture, enjoying watching football and streaming. Remote is a bit hard to use, but we've managed.",

    "The TV has great picture quality for the price but the speaker is terrible. It sounds a busted speaker a week after purchase.Remote is standard issue with smart tvs.",

    "Overall this is a really good TV for the price. My only issue is some white light gets through in a few spots along the top edge towards the left.",

    "Several issues:1) UX. Absolute garbage. Do you want to wait and wait for the Home Screen to load? Do you enjoy a significant lag every time you click the remote? I have to use my old Roku usb as the Samsung Home Screen just doesn’t work.2) Picture. Dark and grainy.3) Sound. Terrible.",

    "For a TV at this price it's good, and it's very thin. Picture is very smooth and looks great. The smart TV features are good as there are many apps in the store. The UI is laggy and not smooth but it's acceptable.My biggest complaint are the built-in speakers. Voices are very low so I have to turn the sounds up very high just to make voices hearable, and when there's action it becomes very loud and I have to constantly turn the volume down, then up again.",

    "I love Samsung TV,S THIS TV HOWEVER HAS SOME UNIQUE QUERKS. ONE DAY IT WILL HOOK UP TO THE BLUETOOTH SPEAKER AND THE NEXT IT WILL NOT.  ONE THEN HAS TO GO INTO THE SETTING AND DO IT ALL AGAIN.. NOT SURE YET IF IT IS THE TV OR THE SPEAKER.?. BUT NEVER HAD THE ISSUE WITH MY OLD TV WHICH IS STILL IN USE UPSTAIRS. THE REMOTE HOWEVER IS A P.O.C .. VERY LITTLE CONTROLS ON IT AND WITH DTV U MUST USE THERE REMOTE..  REMAINS TO BE SEEN JUST HOW GOOD IT IS..",

    "Pissed off",

    "The TV has great picture a lot of smart qualities that make things faster and smoother everything I expected it to be however with one big setback. The TV is completely useless without internet. It's a smart TV of course so whats the problem ?  The TV itself doesn't connect to internet very well there's been times where I haven't been able to use the TV for several hours and I've only had it for a month. It's not my internet service I have 5G internet service with a router directly plugged into the TV with no other devices hooked up,  and if I ever connect any other devices all my other devices work 100% fine I've never had any other internet problems with any other device in my years of living in this home. So I know 100% it is the TV and for a TV that runs even it's most basic mechanics off of Internet which I'm not very fond of I expect that to be the best no brainer part about the TV. For the price I expect better this is the most expensive 4K TV on Amazon. The picture of the TV literally depends on how good your internet can load videos. Most of the time this isn't a problem but it definitely happens on the weekly basis and I've only had the TV for a month and after a while it's already gotten irritating. I randomly try to binge watch something and I have to stop mid watch or I'll try to watch a movie sometimes and the TV will stop working for a few hours. Even the buttons on the remote tweak when the internet connection is messed up like how is that a problem. I'm a big fan of Samsung and I do think the TV is very stupendous when it is running it's definitely worth the money when it is running but they have to figure out a solution for this because the entire TV runs off of a process that it's not even in control of which makes it easily useless, vulnerable and hard to enjoy.",

    "Wish it had a on/off timer",

    "Great TV for the price, but get a sound bar to go with it. The sound is very high treble, with almost no bass. Picture is perfect, easy to set up the streaming apps, and connected to my Echo Show with no problem. Remote is a different design then I am used to but it is sleek and pretty easy to use.",

    "Bought this for my lady friend's home when she had no TV. This one works great and we are very happy with it.",

    "I was not disappointed with this purchase. Have purchased dozens of Samsung TVs and DVRs. The met my expectations. Easy to use and set up and picture quality is great as was the price.",

    "Remote takes 17 clicks to click one thing on tv, constantly disconnects from wifi (it’s not my Wi-Fi) and overall tv is slow and glitchy. Not worth it.",

    "I loved this tv u til it started going dark on its own when the background was already dark. I’ve tried all the things it says on line and when I make the changes and it works until the next time you turn it on. Very frustrating. I cannot find a way to eliminate this problem as others have said on line. Very dissatisfied and too late to return it.",

    "I bought this tv for what I thought was a Black Friday deal which I now realize was just Amazon being shady. I liked the tv at first but after about a month and a half there was some lines and ghosting of the images so I returned it. Could have been just that particular unit was faulty but I am hesitant to buy the same model as a replacement.",

    "Everything as expected. Good purchase",

    "Looks good, functions well as a television. Samsung smart menu system is much better than old menu system. Easy to find shows, connect bluetooth devices, and interface with soundbar.",

    "My husband is in love with the new tv. best purchase ever",

    "Doesn’t format screen size correctly",

    "Worked fine and good picture quality however less than a year in and it is flashing on and off. We’ve been trying for a month and a half to get support out to fix it or replaced it and are getting nothing but a run around. I would not recommend spending the money on a product that is such low quality and even worse customer support.",

    "I enjoy my tv it's crystal clear and sounds great I found it oddly disturbing that the tv has no buttons so I urge you to buy a secondary remote",

    "I want to buy a new model maybe 2023 the one I purchased is 20219 and the remote control wasn't easy to install Thank you Mara Rejo",

    "Poor quality products which break down causing much headaches and costs.",

    "Definitely worth the price",

    "I love this TV. Easy setup and great picture quality.",

    "I recently purchased the SAMSUNG 65-Inch Class Crystal 4K UHD AU8000 Series HDR TV and I am extremely impressed with its performance. The picture quality is stunning, with crisp and clear images, and the 4K resolution makes for an incredibly immersive viewing experience. The HDR technology also adds a whole new level of depth and richness to the colors.The TV also has a built-in Motion Xcelerator which makes fast-moving action scenes look smooth and seamless, and the 3 HDMI ports provide plenty of options for connecting other devices. The TV also has a sleek and modern design that looks great in any room.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this TV to anyone in the market for a new one. It's a great value for the price and the features it offers.",

    "Great Tv and great picture but the quality of the internal components is below average, the TV lasted 1 year because the backlight went out and was not able to fix it.",

    "This is a beautiful device that is giving me the quality I want for actually paying 45 percent less of the original price",

    "It has a light spot on the bottom corner",

    "I have a 13 year old 46 Samsung lcd (120hz), a 6 year old 32 led (60hz) and a 13 year old 23 monitor for my desktop.I do like Samsung products but I wasn't impressed with this TV.I also have a 14 year old 42 Toshiba lcd (120hz) and a 2 year old 22 LG led (60hz).Both of the smaller TVs are 1080p.Honestly, I don't think I'd buy another larger TV without the 120hz refresh rate.It seems like they handle fast moving movies and sports better than the 60hz.Both of the older, larger TVs handled fast movement better than this one so I decided to return it.I'm not sure if the faster refresh rate matters as much with the smaller TVs because those both look fine with fast moving programs.I'll wait until the oled TVs come down a little more in price.",

    "As advertised. Everything works. No issues. I think the quality reflects the price (or vice versa).My only wish would be that it had one more HDMI (it has 3) and my only true qualm would be that speakers are very very weak, like unusually quiet for that reason I knocked down one star. I got a $100 soundbar for this and it's fine (for comparison: internal speakers at 100/100 vol sound about what soundbar sounds at 15/100 vol).Happy with the purchase overall.",

    "We got this TV on cyber Monday before Xmas. We got a HUGE deal. The television is amazing.",

    "Love how clear the picture  is",

    "I hate this tv. Picture quality is on par with modern tvs, but the interface with other devices is horrible. A quarter of the screen turned dark after only 3 months and had to be fixed. The smartcast feature is not nearly as good as the Vizio we replaced and I'm casting from a Samsung phone. I have to constantly re-pair it with the soundbar. I can control the tv with the soundbar (Bose) remote, but only when it feels like responding, which is about half the time. I really can't say enough about the terrible interface and menu. I am truly disappointed with this tv and it will be the last samsung tv I buy.",

    "TV screen broke after 2 months. Half the screen stopped working. Called Amazon and was told to use the manufacturers warranty through Samsung. Samsung sent it to a shop that fixed the issue but physically damaged the frame of TV. There is an actual crack now that we did not cause and they are giving the run around about fixing or replacing the damage they caused. Do not buy this TV. This has been a nightmare.",

    "Picture quality Looks unreal love this tv! Have it pairs with Samsung 650A sound bar",

    "It’s a bit too smart for me but for now I’m loving it!",

    "True colors",

    "The TV is a goood value for the money but it isn’t good for dark rooms especially when there is a dark scene.  There screen brightness isn’t uniform and there are bright spots that interfere / distract with the picture itself.  I had a warrenty repair on the TV and the problem improved only slightly with the new screen replacement.  The two tech’s that came out informed me that this is as good as it gets with the crystal displays.  I ended up returning this TV and opted for an LG OLED TV instead (for a lot more money!)",

    "I've always loved Samsung products and this one is no different! It's sleek without sacrificing quality. The picture is well... Crystal clear! The TV speakers aren't the best out there but given the fact that they sell really high quality sound bars I'm not too upset about it. The dynamic picture settings are really good! I'm picky though so I will tweak them here and there depending on if I'm gaming or just watching a show. The only feature that Samsung really flopped with is the SmartThings function for their TVs, it's really glitchy and doesn't always work as intended. Good thing is that SmartThings isn't instrumental to the function of the TV! Overall I'd say this purchase was more than worth it.",

    "Love it.  Crystal clear picture, I paid for the delivery to bring it into my foyer.  Very easy set up",

    "I bought this for a rental unit and it’s just been a solid all round performer. Not overly flashy, dependable and does the job.",

    "Pixels are dead after 5 months and terrible picture quality would not recommend buying a $1000 tv rather buy Sony and spend $200 more",

    "Love everything about this TV. It even came with samsung tv for free",

    "Samsung user interface and smart features are great as are the overall picture quality and brightness.  I had low expectations for sound quality, but this TV is much worse than expected.  I have a $30 bluetooth speaker I've connected that vastly improves the sound quality.  Bass and even midrange are inaudible without an add-on speaker.  The other issue is the black uniformity.  The TV is extremely splotchy when viewing dark scenes.  There are big blotches of light grey on the black background.  I'd return the TV if I hadn't already discarded the box and mounted the TV.  I have 5 other Samsung TV's without this problem.",

    "sus funcio es son algo lentassus funciones son lentas y a veces se bloquea por lodemas todo muy bien",

    "We haven’t bought a new TV in 10 years. Finally made the jump to purchase this one as a surprise and I wish I would have saved our money. It constantly is stuck loading (we have 5G and no other electronic has an issue loading). It frequently turns on the PlayStation without being prompted to. Heaven forbid you scroll too fast to get to the app you want to open, because then it will freeze the entire screen and then randomly open Samsung TV plus. This TV is a joke. Don’t waste your money.",

    "This unit has a weird bug: after turning it off, it turns itself back on about 30 seconds to a minute later. I saw online that others had a similar problem. I followed their directions regarding settings to try to correct it, but to no avail. Very frustrating.",

    "Replacement for my current fading screen",

    "This TV has brilliant picture quality the smart features are great only complain is sound quality is very poor you will definitely need a sound bar but other than that it's a best buy",

    "I received the television and when switched on the screen had a crack.  I am very disappointed with this, as I bought it as a gift for my mom.",

    "I was excited to get this tv, but I will never, ever buy another Samsung again.It is easily hacked.  I have had to change my account passwords twice, and something continues to easily change the time, even after it is properly set.The software updates automatically, but overall, it's not the quality I expected for a Samsung.",

    "Very bright and clear . Quality is the best",

    "My cat broke my TV and this is a replica. I love it!",

    "Don't let this be your budget purchase. There are better options out there. The picture is great. But the price you pay is subpar connectivity, poor buffering, unresponsive (and out of date) remote, and what may very well be the worst UI I've ever experienced. The remote makes no logical sense, there doesn't appear to be a way to keep the system from turning on peripherals, the list goes on... Spend another hundred bucks or so and get something with more oomph.",

    "Good TV for price",

    "Great TV and great TV for the price. Picture is great. Set up is super easy. The tizen software is fast with loading apps. Most apps are already built in (Roku, sling for ex). I still added my own Bose soundbar using an HDMI. Lightweight too I have already recommended this to many. I switched from an LG.",

    "Got this as a Christmas present for my parents -- they said this is the best TV they ever had. Beautiful sound system, high-quality display. The remote works like lighting speed, and the TV sounds like you are sitting in the theater.",

    "This TV was good for its price when I first bought. I couldn’t stand the fragile skinny remote so I invested in a universal remote. However the reason I’m giving this review is because only 6 months of owning this TV the picture is already starting to go. The screen light flickers the entire top half of the picture. It can be constant for hours. And it’s only getting worse.",

    "I bought 2 - 55 for 2 different bedrooms in May 2022 from Costco at the same time.  First, they both have a click, tick or whatever you want to call it, when you shut it off. At first I thought it was heat expansion. But it is still clicking in the morning. It wouldn't be so bad but it's in the bedroom and it can annoy you all night. Now the TV that gets the most use is starting to flash. The screen flashes and sometimes makes this awful sound like an electrical short. This one will have to go in the garbage. I might be able to sell the one that is just clicking. Don't bother with these. I will see if Samsung can help out somehow but don't have my hopes up. $1,100 thrown out the door.",

    "The television came broken, it came hit, I connected it to see how it came and the screen broke",

    "He loved everything about it! And was very surprised!",

    "Not sure if it's the model or the way it was delivered. But I don't expect this to even last a full year",

    "It’s ok. The picture quality is ok. All the reviews about the sound quality are spot on. It’s really low for some reason and not good quality. As someone else said, I think Samsung wants you to buy the sound bar too. My delivery was good and perfectly packaged.",

    "I bought this with the intention of playing games on it. While I have yet to play actual games on it, watching wise it is pretty efficient. I do love the feature of being able to watch online. Oddly enough it does not have crunchy roll but with the internet app available I am able to login and still watch anime. Still a shame I cannot download epic games store but steam is available.",

    "Got this for my daughter she only watches net flix and you tube stuff so it worked out perfect and easy to set up",

    "I bought this to replace a 17 year old Samsung tv that my husband loved. This new one was a great price, had good reviews and is a little larger which will make it easier for his tired eyes to see from across the room. He was doubtful. It took our SIL 10 minutes to get it unboxed and set up to our firestick. It is being used with no sound and the sound is great. The colors are spot on. I had to wait to do this review until after he could see the purple football uniforms his team wears during the bowl games. The color was spot on for both his team and the MN Vikings - so it’s a keeper.",

    "Tv has nice enough picture and sound but the smart features are god awful they must of put the cheapest cpu they could find in this thing lags all the time and even freezes up sometimes needing a reset. Not enough of a problem for me to go through the effort of returning but now I’ll have to spend more money to get an Apple TV since the built in smart features are next to useless",

    "I game and I needed a good TV and this is one",

    "I regret buying this smart TV.  The remote is useless.  No exit button, no way to close netflix or any other app and get back to regular cable channels. Don't buy",

    "Remote on this TV is terrible in terms of operating",

    "Claims to adhere to VESA standards - lies.Absolute fraud. Cannot mount TV without buying new hardware.Does not support 1440p despite it being a STANDARD RESOLUTION.Thanks for lying, Samsung!",

    "Burned out in 16 months.",

    "We bought this after our previous tv died. We have owned Samsung before and knew the brand was strong. This has not let us down. We get a great picture and have had no issues at all. After trying a different brand before this and it dying in just over 2 yrs will be staying with Samsung for this tv has proven its name once again.",

    "This is A very  good TV for streaming",

    "I love this TV so far. I set it up in about 15 minutes, the picture quality is excellent and the controls are easy to use. The remote is handy, easy. I hooked up my Roku Streaming device so I wouldn’t have to go through and log into all of the streaming apps I use. Couldn’t be happier!",

    "Great smart TV from Samsung. This is my third Samsung TV. Sadly my new 43” was delivered with a blank or bad spot in the right hand field of view. The bad spot is about double the size of a common fly. See video. Hopefully the spot doesn’t spread. We did not damage the unit during unpackaging or mounting.",

    "I bought this for my son for Christmas. I may now buy one for myself. There is nothing wrong with it at all.",

    "I have no complaints about the product. I was able to set it up myself with very little difficulty. My issue is with the delivery. I found this valuable purchase laying on the top step of my porch totally out in the open where anyone could see it. Just a few more steps and it would have been safe and secure from porch pirates and out of the rain. I was furious at where it was left and I can’t believe that UPS would do such a thing.",

    "Amazing picture, even the stock speakers are good, not crazy quiet like most TV's. Easy set up. Works way better hardwired directly to the modem instead of WiFi. Only downfall is upon turning on, the processor is a little slow on the startup and automatically chooses what to turn on before you're able to choose which is kind of annoying. The button layout on the remote could be better, but overall is still a great deal and I would definitely choose again.",

    "This TV is as cheap as it gets. Worked fine for a couple of months, and issues started to appear - react very slowly to remote control, volume control stoped working, and eventually the whole screen is scratched... And since we bought it on Amazon, there is no way to solve the issue.",

    "We've had this TV 1yr & we already have a pixel issue & the color is spotty at times. We've actually ALWAYS went with Samsung & never had any issues until this. Pretty disappointed that this happened within 1yr of purchase.",

    "The tv is great all around, it's a huge upgrade and even with the light bleeding. It's kind of difficult to see it in the pictures but around the edges and in some of the corners there's some light bleed. When watching something brightly colored it's not even noticeable but as somebody who likes horror it can be a bit of an annoyance. Ultimately, it's worth the price and I'm enjoying it though.",

    "Came quickly, was easy to setup and handy with the smart features",

    "Damaged screen",

    "Not terrible, the picture quality is good for the price. And it has good smart features. Biggest gripes:1. The remote is garbage, luckily there is a remote control app for your phone that works fine.2. The sound of the TV is really, really bad. So you will need to get some type of other speaker system.",

    "Got a great deal on Cyber Monday. The TV looks amazing. The remote has a delay in it. I might have to change the batteries and see if that makes a difference. The Smart features are nice as well. I use it with a Samsung sound bar, the surround sound and base makes a huge difference.",

    "The best brand for the price by far. Easy setup. Clear picture...I have 4 TV's like this!!",

    "Nothing to dislike",

    "Works great, takes up very little night table space",

    "Beautiful to watch",

    "Excellente Choice!",

    "Lots of options and great picture. No regrets.",

    "tv has lines running thru it",

    "Super value and awesome picture clarity and features.",

    "We had no problems.  I'm very surprised of the sound on the tv, although we will be purchasing a sound bar.  The shipping was awesome and the drivers were amazing.",

    "I get suckered into buying Amazon for everything because of it's convenience. This TV started to act fumny approx 3 - 4 months after I purchased. Delayed turn on, the time you hit the power button until it turns on is about a solid 5secs. Picture quality, dark pictures (night time or scenes in tge dark) cannot be seen. There's no setting to correct this issue. The only option is to watch the TV in total darkness. Lesson learned on buying expensive item thru a 3rd party",

    "Bought a 50 and a 55 inch for Christmas, very unhappy to open a big box and see the tv is cracked, really can’t think it was because of shipping because it was wrapped and insulated in a box within a box, the 50 inch is ok and works fine,maybe they gave me the wrong 55 inch",

    "The ones I have are too short or to long",

    "I don’t like Not good quality no volume not too much volume",

    "Added this tv to the guest bedroom. It was the right size and weight; ridiculously light. Setup was a breeze with the QR Code option. Speakers are okay, but might add a sounder bar with sub woofer for the extra bass I like when viewing movies. The quick delivery was a bonus.",

    "Now it seems the voice and lips are not in sync.  Still trying to get used to the bright screen.  Difficult to set up.  Had son do it.  Luckily he is a techie.",

    "NA",

    "The picture quality is amazing. I have no issues with the tv as a tv itself, but the interface and smart tv part of it is the worst I’ve ever experienced on a smart tv. I can’t get through a 20 min show on Hulu or Netflix without it freezing at least 3 times in the 20 minutes. If it does start back up it causes sound to unsync and you have to go through the whole process of restarting the app. If you use another device like a stick or PlayStation, you still have to deal with the TV’s awful laggy start menu which freezes up and forces you to have to turn the tv off and on. I feel like I spend more time trying to watch things than actually watching them.",

    "The tv is nice and easy to setup, but the speakers are poor quality. I recommend getting a sound bar.",

    "Put this in the den so the kids can play X-Box and has worked wonderfully. Great picture and for the money a solid TV.",

    "Love Samsung tvs. The picture is amazing",

    "Everything is good",

    "I waited a long time to buy a TV for the living room.  I bought the TV for my Grandchildren.  I love the picture.  The colors and clarity are wonderful.  I do not like the remote.  They combined volume key with CC/VD.  God help you if you accidentally press the key wrong.  It is terribly difficult to get the Voice Assist off.  They cut corners on the remote.  My Cat use to step on my 7 year old Samsung remote, and I had a difficult time getting CC, and the Voice off.  I need to download the Manual on my new laptop.  Samsung needs to make the remote more user friendly.",

    "TV stopped working just after one year. POS!",

    "Love the tv hate the remote. Very small, dark. Hard for an older person to use. Needs to be bigger and lit buttons",

    "Not a good buy if you plan to integrate it into your Alexa systemI have realized that I brought a TV that is not fully compatible with Alexa at it very best. I should have went with my first thought and brought an Amazon TV set. The accommodations I have to make for Samsung TV to be assimilated  with Alexa is tolerable at best. The use of a smart plug to have it turn on (because the TV goes offline in the Alexa appl) and the need of (only) talking into the remote control to make commands is at the very heart of why this TV is not Alexa compatible.Note: Most of  the time Alexa Echo and Dot products most time do not recognize there a Samsung TV online when it is on.The Samsung TV is a great buy for a TV for it TV Features...It is a bad buy if you plan to integrate it into your Alexa network using either the advertised Alexa built-in feature or if you use the Samsung appl Smart thing. I have consider taking it back but this was a Black.This TV did not work with the Alex built-in feature, the remote enabling feature or on the Alexa network.This became such a problem issue I decided to remove it from my wall and return it and buy a Amazon Fire TV Omni QLED Series 4K UHD smart TV from Amazon.The Samsung TV is a bad buy for integration into the Alexa network.",

    "Picture is horrible for a new TV. Any color variations cause pixelation on the screen.",

    "This is a great tv for the money.Very good pictures and lots of features make this a wonderful buy.",

    "Junk . Don't waste your money please listen and get the 9000 series . Expensive yes but why pay for a picture from 2010 .Menu has Ads !Must log in with email to use fully .Go to hell on that Samsung  . Your getting this crap back and can suck it",

    "Great picture. Works very well with Bluetooth speakers. Terrible home screen. I liked the remote control, but it came with a terrible home screen that I could not arrange to suit me. Too many useless built-in apps that cannot be uninstalled. I ended up using the remote that came with my 4K Roku. Still can't get the 60 refresh rate recommended.",

    "Tv didn’t work. This is my first time buying a tv from Amazon and will be the last. The tv was supposed to be a gift and it obviously was a disappointment. Never turned on even trying it in different outlets. Could have been used and returned? Who knows but won’t try it again.",

    "First off the smart functionality of the TV work lighting quick and flawlessly. The built in wireless attenna is above expected quality seamlessly streaming 4k UHD HDR content without a problem dispite being in the basement and across the house from the router. The picture is so good it seems hard to imagine that better tv picture exists even though I know it does.The sound is absolutely horriblly quiet and a huge turn off from how great the picture is. The TV in unbelievably flat so room for good speakers there is not. I wouldn't recommend to anyone to use TV speakers with any kind of higher quality TV anyway as I believe sound to be as important as picture and will be getting a nice sound bar to compliment this TV.",

    "Because of it's size, you will need to be home and the unit is brought into your home/business. Picture is amazing and service was excellent.",

    "It is for our own private viewing at home.  We having trouble keeping the sound setting on.  Having to reset it each time we turn it on. There must be a solution we haven't yet discovered.",

    "Received with a broken screen",

    "I didn't rate the remote, my old tv was a Samsung and the remote was bigger and easier to see and had more features on it and worked with this TV, so I was happy about that.",

    "Remote is terrible and the TV loses sound and and the speakers crackle.weare thinking about returning it!",

    "Very surprised at the poor picture quality on this Samsung TV. I have to question those reviews that say it is good. This is my third Samsung TV purchase over the years and probably my last.",

    "TV seems great. But fox sports app was temperamental, worked when it felt like it. Not sure if it was the TV or the app. But it was during the World Cup, and a major annoyance. TV controls are also super delayed, which is super annoying. But these are first world problems, and all in all things are pretty swell, and the tv ain’t that bad.",

    "We bought a larger version for our living room and decided to get the smaller version for another room.  This is a great TV, easy to set up and use.  The picture quality and sound are outstanding.",

    "This arrived on Friday morning.  Have been using it since that day.  Today is Sunday.  Very easy set up.  Easy to use.  Beautiful picture.  If you have existing accounts with netflix, you tube or prime, use your iphone or smart phone to transfer them to the new tv.  Only takes seconds.",

    "Great price, great quality. Does not come with wall mount screws (of course, neither does any other TV), but the size it takes is very unusual - 8 x 12mm - short and fat (Outdoor Supply has them, Home Depot does not - in the stores anyway. The wall mount you buy may not come with the right size either.).  Love the TV size - small, light, but the picture doesn't seem tiny at all. It think Samsungs' remotes are vastly inferior to LG's, if that's important to you. WHAT I HATE: the we're going to track everything you watch software license. No thanks. Also, I never use smart tv features because I use AppleTV - a vastly superior and very powerful smart TV/streaming box. WORKAROUND if you never need the smart TV features: just say no or cancel the software license part, and it won't put the apps on your Home Screen. You can get into a state where it asks you to do the license, but you can get out of it. This is a really great way to do it if you're only going to use a streaming box and, like I do, also watch over-the-air broadcasts using an antenna. If you say yes to the license, it loads a bunch of apps on your Home Screen, and I don't see a way to remove them - then, the only way to get to the Live-TV/Antenna input is to scroll through the UI. Minor point, but I'm going to be doing this thousands of times and want it do be simple.  If you are using over-the-air/antenna: Connect your antenna first. VERY BAD: during setup, it scans all the antenna channels - and there is NO WAY that I can find to do this again once set up. So, I connected my antenna later and had to reset the entire TV - doesn't take too long to do this, but not a nice feature.  Big Picture: (pun intended): this is a great small TV for an amazing price, especially if you don't mind being tracked and you want built-in apps/smart TV features.  For people like me, there seems to be an easy workaround to use antenna and an external streaming box. So everyone should be happy!",

    "We got this TV on Xyber Monday and it was plenty worth it. Was a lil concerned on pic quality with it being 60 HZ vs 120HZ. No real noticable issues and we have YouTube tv and a PS5. I do not run normal cable, but have been extremely happy with the quality of pictures and functionality.",

    "The TV has a very sharp picture.",

    "Been shopping around for a new TV and I'm glad I found this samsung deal, crystal clear display. Totally worth the money and you can enjoy it",

    "Looks like Samsung didn't spend more than $10 on the remote and speakers togeather.  Samsung could have made it much better by imporving them.  I know sound bar is an option, but they could have used some good quality small speakers in it.",

    "Why to confusing to set up. No customer service from Samsung.",

    "So, right out of the box I was not impressed with this TV at all. As you can see in the pictures, there is some major backlight bleed. I spent a few days playing around with the settings, and for the most part I've been able to make it so it's not super noticeable except if you're trying to watch a really dark movie at night. I don't normally watch movies at night, so I consider that an acceptable solution. I don't know if I would be wasting my time sending this back for a new tv. As far as I've read online, this model of TV does have this backlight issue.Second issue I have is the sound. If you don't have a sound bar, either budget for one or don't get this tv. The sound is absolute garbage. It's so bad. With a sound bar, I have no issues. As others have said, without the sound bar there is a distinct lack of base, and a very tinny sound that is just so bad it's a deal breaker.The major positives of this tv are: price and picture quality. The picture quality on this tv is really, really good. This is replacing a 2020 model Samsung, and I was shocked at how much better the picture quality is than my TU-8000.For the casual viewer, this is an impressive tv. I was able to snag this on Black Friday for under $1,100. If I had the budget for a higher end tv, I would absolutely more for a better tv. However, no tv is going to be perfect and even the highest end models have their flaws.Overall, I am pleased with the tv. It does require some tinkering in the settings to get it to look and sound great, but for the price I'm pleased with it and am happy to have it.",

    "Wasn’t sure what I was getting into as I haven’t had a TV in years. Bought this thing and it just about sets itself up! Picture quality is insane and the speakers are nice and loud for just some little holes there, haha. If you are looking to get some bang for your buck but don’t want to go crazy, this is the tv for you. Thanks Samsung! You actually made something awesome! Well done.",

    "It's damn decent value for how big it is.  Love the remote, once you get used to it.  It's pretty bulky and heavy.",

    "Great picture quality!! Quality and priced well.",

    "Picture was good , then one day the screen went blank and had a white flickering inthe corner of the screen . Will never buy another Samsung Tv.",

    "Be warned,  to get this tv working you need a samsung account.  My experience with samsung.com is uniquely horrible.  stored pw and codes don't work.  It took me 15 minutes and tons of codes and hoops to log in, and this is every time.  Then, things don't work, regardless.  The TV itself is really nice.  Good pics, not hard to navigate and I like the simple remote.Bottom line, you can't use Samsung tech features, if this matters, pick something else.",

    "Really nice tv with lots of additions for new things to watch!",

    "I would not purchase this TV.  The panel on this tv went out only after having the tv for a year and four months. The usage was at 4000 and Samsung Tv should give you 20000 usage hours, per the technician who looked at my tv. Samsung agreed to replace the panel and labor for me but since the panel is no longer available they will not do anything for me because the warranty date expired on Sept. 30, 2022.  My thought is that the tv should have lasted longer then a year and 4 months, maybe this is why a longer warranty wasn't offered? I have another ticket opened to speak to a manager, to see if it gets resolved. Very frustrated with Samsung right now.",

    "For the first 8 months, no issues, having fun gaming, enjoying the Samsung TV, all is happy. One day the from center fade on start up and shutdown now only starts 70% of the time but everything works fine. For the last 2 months there is no fade and as of today, the WiFi decided to stop working. Reset the TV, leave it unpluged for 30 minutes, nada, no idea why it did what it did but I can say timing so close to Xmas, oddly coincidental. Oh, TV is 1 year 3 months old, great purchase to avoid.",

    "Absolute garbage. TV is hardwired and still nothing but freezing and buffering. And multiple other issues. Don’t waste your money.",

    "Great TV!  The clarity and color of this picture is incredible!  The only criticism I have is that the remote is not very good and there are not enough HDMI ports, only 3.",

    "Pretty good picture but understand this is not best quality. This was sold as a black friday item and as such it is a lower quality build.  If your expectation is a perfect image in all color ranges you will be disappointed there is edge light bleed ( quite minimal and you have to look for it) this is a known issue with this model and asking Samsung for repair will be a frustrating and fruitless endeavor.  That being said if you can overlook that small imperfection and knowing that it is a lower end edge lighted panel it can be a good tv and we are happy with it.  To sum up don't expect a perfect tv for cheap.",

    "I like the large size and the ease of setting it up and getting the apps. It works great and has a clear picture.",

    "I love this TV and everything about it. I would purchase it again for another room when needed.",

    "I had purchased this TV originally though Amazon, but with a screw up in delivery I actually had to buy it from Walmart.  The size was perfect for my living room, because we have some high ceilings through the house.  The picture was beautiful and really showed off the UHD very well when I had it paired with my AppleTV, which is now a must on every TV in the house.  Sadly, this TV lasted just 14 months.  I came home from work and found that it would not power on, or was it already on. It would just lightly flash when plugged in.  I had contacted Samsung support and I thought that they were helpful, but really it was a oh so sorry, here is a repair company you can call because you have no warranty since it’s 14 months.  I have many Samsung TVs in the house and some LG’s, but this is the first one to go out and so quickly being inside.  I have an Amazon Fire TV that I just got and put out on the back patio as our second TV, but this 85” TV should have lasted for 10 years and couldn’t make it to 1.5 years. Based upon this experience, I will never buy a Samsung TV again.",

    "Picture quality is excellent. Setup of homepage is convenient and easy to navigate.",

    "So far so good. One thing I'd probably would like is a replay button on remote control.I'm now able to tap into my Amazon free movies that I didn't know I have.I would suggest also get the sound bar. It makes the difference in sound system.No need to get the most expensive sound bar.I got the generic one works fine.I love both mine.I also hired local tech to install at $159 versus the best buys offer of 250 yuck.Check your local first to get it installed and get multiple bid at least 3 installer to get pricing.I also highly recommend to get it delivered, unpacked and try putting it up as pre veiwing see if it fits.Then pack and send back on the spot.It's available as option for freeI did it.They unpacked checked to see if it's broken or something either fit, broken or anything that will make you return it.Use that feature when you click on shipping.I am happy and satisfied",

    "PreciosoMe agrado que llego rapido",

    "I loved the product",

    "All apps in one place, crystal clear picture,",

    "Not only great quality but amazing customer service, most important than other facts",

    "I am so disappointed in this tv. It was great and then one day it just stopped working and turning on. It is not even 2 years old. I wouldn’t recommend this tv.",

    "Super loved it!!! Amazing tv",

    "This order was such an inconvenient hassle! As soon as we turned the tv on there was a thick black vertical line that appeared on the screen permanently. Had to pack this massive thing back up and have it picked up for return. There are no exchanges offered and we lost out on the Black Friday sale, if we were to re-purchase the tv. Not a pleasant experience if you were to get a defective one.",

    "Subtitles won’t turn off on certain movies. Very annoying to try and watch a movie with sometimes. We tried everything to get them to turn off.",

    "As advertised!!!!",

    "Hardly used Tv stop working two months after 1year manufacture warranty.will never purchase a Samsung again.",

    "Had it for a year and we still love it. Only criticism is some of the buttons on the remote are easy to bump inadvertently. Would definitely purchase again.",

    "The picture quality is excellent. It is the only thing excellent about this TV. I need Roku to make my cable work. I either pay for Roku or cancel my cable. I can't find the Angel Studios app. There are several apps I can't find. The sound is not good. Now I'll have to invest in a Soundbar. I had an older Bose model but this TV has no way to connect it. I actually hate this TV. I had to wait so long for one of my kids to set it up I'm past the return date. I never would have thought I would hate a Samsung so I didn't give a thought about a possible return.I recommend getting help from an expert before you buy. Make sure you are willing to give up your apps and other usual features before you spend your hard earned money.",

    "My expectations of the flat screen TV quality have been far exceeded. It was super easy to set up, both from a physical and technology standpoint. Crystal clear picture, perfect smart features.But the remote control is microscopic! WHY??? This is evil. I can't pick it up without hitting buttons that I did not intend to. Just incorporate the same technology in a human sized remote control. WHY NOT??? EVIL.",

    "Awesome Samsung TV. Received my 50 inch a couple of days ago. Love everything about the TV so far. Bought the TV to play my video games. Perfect for gaming. The sound is a bit ok, Not the best but good enough. Definitely add a soundbar. Other then that, awesome tv for the price.",

    "The delived it with the upmost care and expertise",

    "This is a good tv for the money. Has lots of features and apps. The picture quality is very good even old black and white moves.The speakers don't produce much in the way of base. So you probly need to add a sound bar to enhance the sound quality.But other then that this tv is perfect",

    "We already had this TV, but my son threw a car at it and cracked the screen. Decided to purchase it here. It really is a great TV. Set up is very easy. VERY happy with my purchase.",

    "I have never been more unhappy with a purchase than with this TV. Within 10 seconds I realized that the TV was not good, the gray colors are very bad ((see screen uniformity test in the photos) and the edges are much lighter than the rest of the image. The screen backlight was bleeding a lot. I exchanged the TV for one that hopefully wasn't broken.Unfortunately, this one has exactly the same problem, but a little less bad. Samsung says this is normal for this model. Unfortunately I cannot get a refund.Be aware that this TV has no smart functions if you use it in the Caribbean! Fortunately, you can change the location settings in a hidden place, so that you can still use Airplay 2, among other things. But WHY Samsung?Do not buy this TV! It is a budget model for a mid-range price! I very much regret this purchase.",

    "Amazon was the seller. I paid 797 black Friday sale.Amazon home delivery, unpacking, and TV placement was wonderful.Alexa setup... Setup Alexa using the TV settings on the TV (settings, general, voice, voice assistant). Install the smart things skill in the Alexa app on your phone.Install the smart things app on your phone to use the app like a remote control, if you want.After setting up the built-in Alexa on the TV AND installing the smart things skill on Alexa app on your phone, Alexa can get confused depending on what you're asking it to do. Alexa either won't work, or it will say do you want to use your Samsung TV or your Samsung TV. To solve these problems...When setting up Alexa routines, set the FROM device to be the Samsung TV, not your phone or echo dot, etc. The exception is if you have a routine to turn on the TV; for that routine, set the FROM device to be echo dot.See the attached screenshots from the Alexa app for examples of how to setup Alexa routines.",

    "I’m amazed at the quality of this TV! Even the non-4K content is sharper and brighter. Although I had a little trouble getting the app to recognize the TV At first but once it did it definitely made set up easier. I love how easy it is to switch between inputs and setting up my streaming subscriptions were a breeze. I can’t wait to watch baseball this spring in 4K!!!",

    "If what you're looking for is a decent screen with a few HDMI slots (and a simple means of toggling across them) you should not buy this bloated mess of a device. It comes festooned with apps (really just chincy advertisements for every streaming service under the sun). The interface hides settings and input toggles in a corner, ticked behind an insistant wall of ads and relentless  reminders. Even the remote, which only has about a dozen buttons on it, is branded, with three service-specific buttons clogging up an unnecessarily spartan face. Awful.",

    "I bought this during a cyber Monday sale and was super excited to surprise my mom with a nice big high quality branded TV, so she doesn't have to keep squinting at her phone in her room like she has been all year. It was a rough year and I wanted to get her an early birthday gift.Unfortunately Amazon delivered the TV very early in the morning and left the package IN THE COLD OPEN RAIN FOR HOURS! Even if it were there for a moment it should have been placed under a ceiling and not on a WET GROUND! Worried, I took it out of the box in hopes of drying it out but the water already made its way into the screen and bled all across it upon testing.Because this was purchased during a promotion Amazon will not replace my moms TV (that they damaged). Now I have to go through another procedure in returning this. I will never buy a TV from Amazon again.",

    "Perfect edge-to-edge. Far better than the last Samsung, which was also nice.",

    "Me gusto.No me ha dado ningun problema, hasta ahora la recomiendo!",

    "When trying to open Hulu I keep getting an error that says this web page is not available error code: -21 (net error network changed).It is LITERALLY the app they have pre-installed on the TV. When I try to update the app or reinstall there is no option to do that. This has been happening for 4 out of the 10 days I have had the TV.Update 12.5.22 I spoke to Samsun customer care via Amazon support and they were utterly useless. The man from Samsung told me to connect my computer to the TV. My computer is currently being repaired by Asurion.  I told him as much. He told me to get a flash drive. I told him I have not used a flash drive since 2012 or 2015 and have no idea where one might be. Samsung customer care told me to buy one. When I asked why I would buy a flash drive to make a TV I have had less than 15 days work correctly he told me to borrow one from somebody. At that point I just hung up on him.Now I will likely have to buy a firestick for a brand new smart TV that I have had less than 15 days.",

    "Decent TV. Wouldn't pay more than I did for it, but good for the price.",

    "All good",

    "Pixels were out and as we all know that can happen. Company was great on returning product. Was very happy with service.",

    "Our 32” tv had better sound than this tv. It’s honestly the worst speakers I’ve ever heard from a TV. I guess we are forced to get a sound bar now",

    "Excelente Smart TVBuena calidad de imagen.",

    "Easy to use, great picture. Just need to add a sound bar. Every tv needs one though.",

    "Product arrived fast. Undamaged. Installation was fairly easy. Auto set up worked. It takes some time to set up all the apps. But here is the thing: the sound is terrible. Uncannily canny! My iPad sounds much better!So we had to invest in a soundbar.",

    "About 2 months after receiving the TV, the display would pixilate once in a while. Unplugging it and plugging it back in would solve that. That was slightly annoying but I figured I could love with it. I should have known better than to not contact them immediately. Fast forward to 10 months after purchase, the TV started to make a noise about 30 seconds after turning it on, then the screen would started pixilating, then going black across the bottom, and then the TV would start cycling itself off and on going through that noise, pixilate, go black process with the display every time. I tried unplugging to let sit, updating software, disabling the power function with the mobile app (the mobile app never would connect to the TV), and none of it worked. I tried this on and off for several weeks since I don't watch much TV. I finally contacted Samsung support and their response was that the 1 year manufacturer warranty had expired. Even though I offered to provide them dated video evidence that the TV had gone dysfunctional since before the date of expiration. They offered to send out a repair person which I would have been charged for but would do nothing else. Add to this the fact that their microwaves commonly start housefires, and I know I will never buy another Samsung electronic again. They are garbage.",

    "First, we have been satisfied with other Samsung devices including a tv.  We had this set in mind for several months and finally bought it.  Out of the box the sound quality was tinny and hard to listen to, much poorer than on our five or six year old Samsung set of the same size.  The available settings helped little.  The small remote is hard to use; terrible compared to the detailed remote for our older Samsung 43 set.I bought an inexpensive sound bar (different brand) solely to obtain acceptable audio for routine tv viewing.  The sound bar is connected via upgraded HDMI cable to the ARC jack on the tv.The problem now is that audio from the sound bar and tv video are out of sync.  I have spent  a couple hours with the e-manual open on my laptop trying to adjust for this to no avail.  Meanwhile we are awaiting delivery of a better sound bar and will attempt to achieve acceptable results with that.  If unable to rectify the sync issue, I will have no choice but to return this tv without ever having the opportunity to try all the smart features we want.",

    "No issues so far.. Picture is good",

    "HermosoEs perfecto",

    "First of all the delivery was botched, I specifically ask for a Saturday delivery as the purchase instructions said someone had to sign for the TV.  I get a notice a few days later its being sent on Friday - now what, before I could even call I get a notice UPS is delivering it on Thursday in the afternoon; move schedules all around only to get a ping from my ring door bell that it was dropped at 10AM - no signing and the its just left by the front door for everyone to see!!!!! ....  TV set up was fine, - smart TV REQUIRED YOU TO REGISTER FOR SAMSUNG APPS AND GIVE A CREDIT CARD!!!  - Don't like...  Also - we have been long time ROKU users and I just wanted to add that app back with my account and all my Apps and set up.. NOOOOOOO - Samsung blocks ROKU as they view it as a competitor to get $2.99 a month out of me - UGH!!!! ....  Still trying to work around this or just plug my ROKU back in, but then WHY WOULD I HAVE BOUGHT A SMART TV only to bypass it - UGH number 2...  Agree with other comments - instructions and operation of the remote is  awful - who thought of have a black remote with buttons in black and on a slight etching in them would be useful to see....  For a high end TV - its a low end finish.",

    "Has good smart features - but viewing angles are terrible and lots of reflection and some backlight bleeding from the sides (non-uniform black level)... It's fine, but not an especially high quality TV",

    "So far this TV has performed wonderfully!  As someone who has never had a HDTV it was hard to get used to.  In researching it I found that I could put it on movie mode to take away that unreal/what they call soap opera look.  It is much better for me on the movie mode.",

    "it’s a good tv but if purchased make sure purchased with sound bar but other better tvs can be found",

    "The remote is very small. It need to have a light feature to see what buttons you are pushing. The volume it the worst I’ve ever experienced. Please buy a sound bar if you purchase this tv.",

    "Love my Samsung tv.  Feels like the movie screen.",

    "As advertised and more. These TVs are excellent.",

    "Previously purchased a smaller version of this same model AU8000.  Pricing from Amazon was great and door to door delivery was especially convenient.  The picture quality is truly phenomenal although the sound quality is definitely not great for this size screen.  Lots of options for simply sound bars and I will likely purchase one but I cannot say enough about the 4K picture.",

    "Arrived late and broken no option to replace only return",

    "WAS a decent tv, good picture quality - but broke down a few months after factory warranty ran out. Half the price of the cost to fix it. Said eff it and got a SONY as the replacement. Disappointing... never buying Samsung again probably",

    "Buyer beware! Bought this 14 months ago as a splurge for myself. Did not go cheap went for quality- what a joke. 14 months later black screen and all I get is sorry not under warranty. Ridiculous! This hung on my wall in my bedroom. Was not abused in anyway. Shameful. I will NEVER buy a Samsung product again. You shouldn’t either.",

    "Arrived in perfect working condition.God Is Good!!",

    "This is a nice television at a reasonable price. Honestly, I'm not the kind of person who cares about ultra clear picture or the newest bells and whistles (our old TV was a decade old, only replaced because it was breaking). My wife and I both wear glasses and we both tend to not watch the TV very carefully anyway. So for us we just needed a good devise that did the basics well for a good price. This TV does that perfectly.",

    "Have not had any problems with this yet and would recommend it for the price. The person who did the review lasted 13 months  should write a book, longest review I've read but also very interesting,informative and useful. I mostly use mine for watching movies, thank you Samsung for another great product.",

    "This is our first smart TV ever. Overall, we are pleased with the accessibility and features. We regularly watch Hulu LiveTV, Netflix, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video. I wish there was shortcuts on the remote for all these streaming apps, but I understand it's probably not feasible due to ownership, licensing, and the ever-changing streaming environments. The wall mount we used already came with our house, so I cannot comment on brands or compatibility - I just can say that it worked! And we did NOT need to buy a new wall mount.My only CON to this TV is the sound quality. And maybe that's because it's mounted to the wall? The sound does NOT seem to project outwards into the living very well. However, you can hear every commercial word-for-word on the other side of the wall in the bathroom. We have to keep the audio turned up fairly high to hear what is being said on TV. This could be enhanced with a sound bar, but that's an added piece of equipment that shouldn't be necessary.",

    "This TV had terrible backlight bleeding around the edges. During dark scenes, there was light coming through on the edges and bottom of the screen. Also, the remote control was super frustrating. There's like 4 useful buttons on there. Samsung should hire more UX and product designers.I returned this TV and bought an LG instead. No more Samsung for me.",

    "If you have a separate streaming device (Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, etc.) to use, this is a phenomenal television. If your wanting to use the streaming apps for this “smart” tv, you’ll be left frustrated and wanting. I must confess myself deeply disappointed in the performance of this tv outside of picture quality.",

    "Sound is awful",

    "Deliver was quick, setup requires a Samsung account - not somthing I like.  Great picture.  The apps for Netflix, Hulu, etc are very slow (I hooked my AppleTV up to one of the HDMI ports).  The remote has tiny little buttons hard to get used to, Although I imagine Samsung expects you to use the voice option.",

    "Present for my daughter. 10 months after purchase a thin appeared at the bottom of the TV all the way acrossed it.The line is constantly there.",

    "Love the picture, but hate the sound very tinny and scratchy.  Had to buy a sound bar.",

    "The sound is horrible. I tried to adjust the sound settings but no luck. It crackles.",

    "The clearest picture I have ever seen on any television. Easy setup.",

    "The image is crystal clear and is very easy to install and program all your apps. One of the best parts is the Samsung Plus option. I don’t have cable just Wi-fi and that helps a lot and save you from a cable bill.",

    "Easy to install.....my husband loved it",

    "Great TV with picture that makes various series appear like live TV",

    "I bought a Samsung TV in 2009 and it still works today. Unfortunately this TV lasted only 13 months before developing several issues. Initially I was blown away by the picture. It was unbelievably colorful and crisp and just a huge improvement from 1080p. I'm old school so all the things I could do with it were amazing as well. I have one of the first apple tv's and paid a few bucks for it but this tv has it built right into it which amazes me. I don't have home internet so I really didn't even use most of the bells and whistles on this TV but using my Hotspot I was able to check some of them out. When I turned the TV on the startup image alone was absolutely amazing and everything else followed suit but now here I sit watching you tube videos trying to decide if I even wanna bother fixing it. My old Samsung had an issue with the main board that cost me around $60 to fix and it was well worth it considering I paid somewhere around $2000 for the TV. This one was considerably cheaper and I'm just not sure I want to be bothered. I guess I most likely will end up trying to fix it though because I can't afford another TV.So here's what happened. I noticed black horizontal lines near the bottom of the screen. Than a few weeks later when I tried to turn the TV on I had trouble getting it to power on. When I did there were black inky looking spots on the screen. From there it got harder and harder to get it powered on and sometimes that black inky look would go across the entire screen. The picture quality has suffered overall when it does work. At this point those are all intermittent issues besides the horizontal lines which are constant. So yes the TV is usable for the most part but since I doubt it'll fix itself I guess I'm left forking out the money and time it'll take to fix this thing and it's disappointing at best.So it's a tough call for me as to whether I would recommend this TV or not. The picture was great, it has some nice features, it's extremely lightweight and compact compared to earlier models which explains why people aren't afraid to mount them on their wall or ceiling, and the price would be great too if it worked like it should. Maybe I just got a bum TV and if that's the case I'm not surprised but that's why I guess I gotta say you get what you pay for. If you want something you can depend on your luck and your money will probably have to invest in something with a bigger price tag.Eventually I will be digging into the problem with mine and I'll update this review with what I come up with at that point.",

    "Nothing to dislike about this Samsung Television. It has lots of perks. I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOOOOOOVE IT!!",

    "I can't say enough about this SAMSUNG 43-Inch Class Crystal 4K UHD AU8000 Series. The colors are vivid. The smart features are more than what I would have expected it would have. The TV comes with the Samsung TV Plus App which has Live TV, On Demand Movies, News, H&G, Crime, etc.... and the list goes on with over 200+ free channels. All you need for this is a router with either a network cable and or Wireless 2.4g or 5g. It comes with 3 HDMI ports and 2 USB ports. A 5v & 1v No matter what you connect to the tv, the Smart Remote learns the function whether a Blu-Ray, Firestick or Surround Sound Receiver. I upgraded my remote to the solar remote and don't have to worry about batteries anymore. I've got HBO-Max, Showtime Go. Starz, VUDU, Amazon Prime, Paramount and the list goes on with enough room for several more apps and 1.7Gb's of space left. One of the features I really like is being able to access the portable WD-5T wirelessly. I have it hooked up to the router via USB where I have 100's of movies stored. For a entry level television priced at under $400.00, it has a high end look & feel. It can be bought right now for under $350.00 here at Amazon.",

    "Bought this new TV and it was defective.  When you plug it up, it makes a ticking noise and no sound.  Spoke to Amazon Customer Service.  I was transferred to Samsung Technical Support.  Did what they ask and still the problems were not solved.  Ask for a replacement and Samsung indicated that they can only provide a replacement if I bought it directly from them although the TV is still under warranty. Thus Samsung asked me to contact Amazon which I did and was told the TV can't be replaced as Amazon didn't have the TV in stock.  I go online and realized that the TV is in stock.  The customer Rep did offer a small compensation for my troubles with this defective TV but it cannot offset the almost $700 which I paid Amazon.  This was too much stress after paying almost $700.00.  Amazon needs to hold Samsung to account when they provide them with defective items so that they can better address customers' issues with regard to defective items.  The customer should not be the one with the loss as Samsung and Amazon have a duty to ensurethat every customer gets exactly what he/she purchase.",

    "TV came smashed on the bottom. When it arrived plug it in and it's  SMASHED OUT..",

    "Post office couldn't fit the TV in mailbox so it is really too big",

    "Couldn't watch our favorates.",

    "I bought this because it was Samsung and I needed a TV with a Smartthings hub. The description says it supports smartthings, and it does, but not with the hub abb.  You can add it to your phone app, but it does not have the TV app, nor can it be installed. A bit of marketing sleight of hand.PIcture quality is pretty good.  Remote home button is confusing... doesn't always go home.",

    "Great product but only lasts a year until the backlight goes out and it’s practically broken. Half the screen is black and it costs almost as much to fix it as buying a new tv. Not worth buying",

    "Everything was great except for the sound. Too low, woofer was loose, causing “booms” every time a song was playing in films. The bass was awful. Had to buy a new TV. This time I bought an LG,",

    "Amazing picture get SAMSUNG TV 500 CHANNELS FREE!!!",

    "Good price.",

    "Fairly disappointed with this tv. I purchased it less than a year ago and over the last six months it has gotten worse and worse with connectivity. It is not my network connection because other tvs and devices in my home work fine. It’s becoming more frequent I can’t even use this tv because it losses connection.",

    "Many techy features that I don't know how to use, but the kids do but overall, beautiful quality.",

    "Great picture tv changes format automatically when watching a movie. Talk into the remote. Best tv I have ever had. I put the Samsung sound bar with it and it’s like a movie theater in my house. You need this TV! Best price around too. Better than the Black Friday deals.",

    "My garage door opener has a higher quality remote.  It does not even have numbers on it. CHEAP.  Difficult to use.  Also, why not include the mounting bolts with the TV?  They cost 20 cents and save a trip to the hardware store.  Will see how this holds up.",

    "This is the third time I have had issues with Samsung televisions. Never another Samsung again.",

    "Super easy set up. Even easier if you already have a Samsung account. TV comes VERY WELL PACKAGED and is simple to unbox. Very thin and sleek. Picture quality is amazing. Another high quality Samsung product!",

    "The picture quality is great for the price, but the smart apps are about worthless, they load incredibly slow, and some of them still force you to cast from your phone (I’m looking at you FloSports).The remote is super touchy, look at it wrong and it leaves the app or channel you’re watching (see section above about slow loading apps)",

    "AMAZINGI love the Crystal clarity and there’s nothing I dislike about it. This may sound corny, it’s a new experience of watching tvA Samsung UHD, I love it",

    "Lasted 13 months!!!!",

    "Found reason for the great price.  Will purchase sound bar. I’ve actually never owned a TV with such bad sound quality.  Picture and everything else perfect!  Actuality never had a TV with such great picture and smart features.",

    "BuenoBueno",

    "TV stopped working literally after 1 month of buying new. The screen turns black after a few minutes and only sound working. I have contacted samsung support multiple times and they sent someone out twice. Both times the technicians did not have the parts or ability to fix it and I would need to contact support again. It takes support minimum of 15 days to get back to you even though I was calling daily. They continued to say we are working to resolve but nothing ever got done. It's been 3 months since I first contacted them and the TV is still not working. I requested to return this but they keep saying we will have to outsource the return and they will contact you in 2-3 days which is a straight lie. I have never experienced such poor customer service and still have not received refund or repaired TV. It doesn't seem that there is a solution in the near future and I highly suggest that anyone considering this TV to look at other brands. The TV was literally one month old before it stopped working.",

    "Great buy",

    "Picture quality in terms of color and sharpness is below average!",

    "I was concerned about buying a TV online, but let me tell you that it was quickly put to rest. The setup was effortless and straightforward. The picture quality is excellent and the instructions were easy to follow. I paid extra for the room of choice for delivery and the gentleman was nice. I'm glad I made this purchase and will recommend this TV to everyone.",

    "I recommend this tv",

    "Deep blacks and vivid colors , this tv checks all the boxes . Shipping was fast and well packaged , this tv will hopefully last longer than the vizio it replaced .",

    "Works well 5+ months without any problems.Remote control is bit minimalistic but got used to it.Cannot comment on smart features since I turned OFF most of them",

    "I am in Love with the quality of this Samsung. I even love the Samsungplus tv feature that plays music. I don't even miss having a radio.. And has the best style for relaxing in your home. I'm still figuring out all of its features.",

    "Setup is easy and the picture is fantastic! My only gripe with this set is the sound quality. My phone has better sound when playing videos. There is a very tinny quality and is just awful. It's clear that I will have to buy a sound bar or something.",

    "Great tv",

    "Nice",

    "Great TV for the price",

    "The TV looks smaller than 55 I have a 50 inch inch, can't see the difference. The remote is too small and it's not user friendly, at all. Too soon to rate the overall performance since I only received it yesterday.",

    "Everything is good except the sound, I don’t complain because I have a sound bar.",

    "Pleased with the quality and it came fast.",

    "Great TV for price. Samsung always quality",

    "Smart features would only work if they were completely compatible. I have 3 tablets and other laptops that are on Android this is on it's own Tizen platforms.Now I know people are going to say just use the Google apps not all those apps will work with every Android. If you have older laptops, tablets, smart devices around the house you will have trouble with the remote pairing.The remote control is a waste Soo small, but the big headache is the TV and remote and how they don't work together , if you are in one setting and want to just go home, guess what it's not allowed you have to back out of each setting by using the back button you can't just hit home. This is the new Tizen system, go with the Android it's used a heck of a lot more pairs easily with your electronics.In a last try to get this unit to operate with my other equipment a call was made to Samsung, they were completely understanding and we tried together to find different apps on Google that allows my other equipment to pair for 75 minutes it was a no hitter. The end result update or buy new electronics that have the correct versions. Also look at the apps on Google play for the Samsung TV, you think you have the right one you won't, not even Samsung could without switching me to different departments twice.In all fairness the picture quality is awesome, But I will Not accept all the other things I have mentioned here.This will be returned I will only buy a Android system.I didn't take all this time to bash Samsung this my experience with the Tizen os , the factory can't help me, it is what it is.You have been warned.",

    "Less than a year old and left side of screen is going dark.  Have contacted Amazon and transferred to Manufacturer.  Samsung has been wonderful so far.  I called, tv under warranty, assigned a claim number.  Service will call within 24-48 hours for appointment.  Very professional courteous service.",

    "Great TV. Glad I bought it. The remote is intuitive once you get used to it. Relatively snappy OS for a Smart TV. Amazing picture. I’m really happy with this purchase.",

    "Replaced another TV that I had at home.",

    "Does not disappoint",

    "The remote control has a lag.  It take a couple of seconds for the button pressed to react.  I have to scroll menus for the timer to come up.  I have to scroll to change the source for switching to a disk player.  This is not acceptable.  Also, when I turn on the tv, why are all these features like Youtube, Tubi, Hulu, and many others  blocking the screen for ten seconds?",

    "Disappointed in the quality of the audio",

    "big",

    "TV is fantastic but the remote could use some make over.  Overall best purchase I have ever made.",

    "Love the TV. The sound can definitely be better. Going to purchase a sound bar.",

    "Multiple issues with User Interface and Experience:1) Wireless connection keeps dropping when I turn on the TV and unable to connect (no problems with other Sony/LG brands so not my wireless router)2) Slow and buggy experience with watching shows vs. watching it on my Sony/LG TVs a) I'd be watching a fully downloaded show and it takes forever to rewind/fast forward b) subtitles would just disappear all of a sudden and I'd need to restart the TV to get it to come back3) I have to go through multiple steps to play off USB, load subtitles, and trying to navigate their SMART menu is more complicated4) Every single input from the Samsung remote takes time takes more time for it to respond whereas it is instantaneously for the Sony/LG models I own",

    "Installed in family room, volume will not go loud enough to enjoy in large room.",

    "it kept wanting me to sign into a Samsung Account to add stuff, not happy with then owning everything ya do",

    "Worse remote on the market! Navigation is absolutely horrendous and takes away from what should be a great television. Some Prime Movies look as if they've been fed through a mud filter and nothing done in the setting to adjust the quality of the movie in question helps. I'd of returned this boobtube had the return window not crept up so quickly! Don't waste your time or money. This one is a DUD Samsung!!!",

    "I've had this so-called smart flat panel a year now, after researching a month or so when a slightly smaller Insignia brand died unexpectedly after maybe two years of infrequent usage far short of its listed lifetime hours. And for LCD televisions in this price range I expected at least something from this new unit to have made it worth the purchase.It has not delivered on the promotional hype of so many supposedly unbiased review sites, in any aspect, let alone even come close to being adequate on just basic features any TV of this size should provide. I was suckered and wasted our money, with the only bonus easing the sting having been able to make five payments - although in retrospect all of the issues probably have something to do with paying in that fashion being allowed in the first place.Some highlights -* The blacks without adjustment are so dark as to be more or less unwatchable. This can be somewhat adjusted using the preset modes along with (not a stand alone setting) their respective manual slider, but in all cases has been atrocious yet even when changing the gamma dark pixels tend to smear while being quite grainy.* I don't know what genius in the Samsung marketing or executive department forced the engineers to create the hard programming as coded, but in that respect this unit is beyond annoying, bordering into abusing their customers. Need to reinstall an included app; sign up for a Samsung account. Need to do X or Y, sign up for a Samsung account. Only had the unit a year but need to address some kind of computer moment; sign up for a Samsung account, even to the point today of having to go through the AmazonTV.com process of registering a device to stream Prime. Try to otherwise fix the issue of Prime cache or app maybe being corrupted; sign up for a Samsung account.* As purchased there are numerous apps you cannot delete or unload, and when trying to reorder the Home bar owners are not allowed to change the position of certain services, whether or not they ever use that app. The unit itself may at times reorder what you've previously changed.The unit also gets confused frequently by this last app feature when trying to restart the hard-coded SAMSUNG TV+ channel (some kind of horse soap opera titled Heartland, but when we first got it a holiday music video channel was the default)  after being off or having been used for another source input. For example, if you haven't watched a blue-ray in a month, the TV may decide to keep turning on the player anyways (empty of a disc, mind) every time or most times you repower the flat panel. I've even unplugged the player, and the TV will still often try to turn it on anyways as if it was the last used app.If Prime or a channel you do watch was used last, you cannot set it to being the enabled app on startup if it isn't in their chosen list, period.* Infrequently over the past year, incoming phone calls of those unavailable number phishing variety by folks of Indian origin pretending to be all sorts of real services will cause the TV to think it cannot stream, and it will often lock up for a few minutes or so. Likewise, you cannot set the unit to not try to update itself in the middle of watching it, and it isn't smart enough to maybe schedule that for later instead of when the users are partway through a rented high-def movie.* Sound, is more or less nonexistent. I've owned unpowered PC speakers that could equal the lower end of the volume setting. While a DVD played music disc may only require 10 or less (out of 100) on the bar programs that would blow out your eardrums on an old tube television typically require settings at least around 40, and it isn't uncommon to bump into the 70s for movies or shows targeted towards Dolby setups. A recent rental of Maverick required a bump into the 80s and still felt kind of muted in many portions of the film, yet far too loud in others; very inconsistent overall as per usual with this unit.I haven't decided if the TV rates a separate purchase of a sound bar able to hook up via optical cable.In sum, ignore the hype as there are no smart features or advantages to owning this smart television. In truth it can be watched, but not enjoyed. Whatever unit so many review sites advised about, or the countless reviews here touting features, they must all be trying to watch some other flat panel entirely.",

    "Purchased this SAMSUNG 43-Inch Class Crystal 4K UHD AU8000 Series HDR, 3 HDMI Ports, Motion Xcelerator, Tap for my bedroom.  My husband likes all the smart features and how it connects to his phone and he can play from his phone.  The picture quality is good.  It was a good buy for us.  It was the size we needed for the wall space we had available.  It seemed to be super light and thin compared to another television we already have.  We are happy with our purchase.",

    "The sound  is awful. Really bad quality, need ti buy a sound bar.",

    "There is a problem with this tv...",

    "So happy with Amazon's delivery.I ordered on Tuesday it was delivered 2 days later before 10am.Carefully packaged and the tv was in excellent shape.Great tv for the price.",

    "Calidad de imagen.El tamaño es excelente.",

    "Complete waste of time and money.  Very tough to return, as well.  We have fiber optic wifi, and we get only 20mbps on the TV (even when right next to the wifi) which means it is useless and laggy.",

    "Kind of disappointed. The screen has a lot of discoloration and that's pretty frustrating. Going to return it but may be a challenge since I already through out the box.",

    "Terribly tinney sound quality",

    "I ordered this tv on a Saturday night and it was at my house on Sunday morning.  But so far the quality is very nice and it has all streaming apps built right in which is nice.It's also very slim it looks really good tucked up against the wall. So far it's well worth the money. Ps. Get the 4yr warranty for like $45 it's well worth it for that price.",

    "Wouldn’t even turn on half the time. Only had it for a few days. I would not recommend.",

    "It’s a alright TV. Not the best but not the worst. Comes with free Samsung TV and and it has almost all the streaming services already installed. The remote is like very laggy to the point it can get annoying at times.Personally I had to wait like 5 days after the delivery date cuz the delivery kept delaying. I was in a position where I needed the tv and I was going out of town. Also there was a small little crack on the back of the tv like someone poked the box with a pencil or box cutter or something.I didn’t want to go through the hassle of waiting for delivery again and returning the damn big tv; nothing was wrong with the picture quality or screen so I just wall mounted it and called it a day.",

    "Though this Television initially worked fine, it stopped working immediately after the year warranty expired. Though the TV cost $340, we were going to be charged somewhere between $340 and  $850 to get it repaired.",

    "Pixels went out creating a line across TV",

    "I had this for only a couple of months before I had to file a warranty claim for ghosting — only visible in a dark room so wasn’t noticeable on long summer days. Had a repair done under warranty (took a month plus to schedule), and the repair still has the same issue.Remote sucks and Samsung smart interface is slow and unresponsive.Overall an expensive piece of junk.",

    "We are very pleased with the selection of this television.  It was delivered promptly, before stated delivery date even.  The one issue as seniors were instructions.  There are hardly any instructions with mounting and are written in very small print.  The remote is very small and after having the tv for several weeks now, navigating the buttons is still a challenge.  On a wonderful positive note, the tv is wonderful, beautiful picture.  The online instructions on setting up the apps and channels were very informative and helpful.  We are set up on antenna which has its own set of issues but the tv adjusted automatically and easily.  Highly recommend.",

    "The picture is great on this, but the audio is laughably bad. It sounds like a cheap Sony Ericsson phone in the corner of the room. If you plan to connect with speakers then no problem, but if you expect to use the built-in speakers then I would strongly not recommend. The sound is significantly worse than my 10 year old Samsung TV I was upgrading.",

    "Ease to setup.  Great picture.  Need to order sound bar...Tv speakers good but not clear enough..Great buy!",

    "I just pull it out the box , big nice TV quality is great so far I love it",

    "Love the TV,  but beware,  it is very heavy.",

    "I am finding many,many features to adjust and turn on or off to control every day. The speakers are OK for normal sound and an EQ can be enabled. I bought 2 Bluetooth 5.0 headsets from SoundCore and noticed some inputs had that Bluetooth sound sync mismatch showing lips moving too late or early. I read about AptX LL (low latency) enabled TV and Headsets required for Video use with syncing sound with video. The sync off because I FF or RW streaming bit too much ...with non AptX phones I feared I had to buy 2 new headphones but it went away by it self. HDMI input #2 has the advanced type HDMI plug. I used that for my Xfinity Arris 4K cable box with a DVR HDrive or SSD. You need the small new XG1v4 DVR/cable box to output 4K to TV from them or they can send the tiny non-DVR one to go with normal HD box that does cloud only 4K. The only problem is the XG1v4 4K DVR cannot be controlled by the small Universal Remote provided currently. I tried the 20 attempts many times and even chose Arris as the manufacturer and the model #AX014ANM and the XG1v4 name and nothing works yet like on the other Xfinity boxes I had for a while. It says make sure your cable box is set for IR infrared to work but the cable box is fixed RF radio frequency only not dual type. Too bad the  Remote is not dual output. Have to have 2 remotes. Vastly better than my old 2016 Sharp 55.",

    "Delivery was fine, I guess.  It was a “drop and run” situation - last time we ordered a TV from Amazon delivery was via a private company that actually unpacked it and plugged it in.  This was delivered by Amazon and it was left on our porch with no knock or doorbell ring.This TV Arrived with damage to the box and the back of the TV crushed.  Miraculously the TV worked but we still returned because we were concerned that the the back would give out when mounted.They picked up 5 days after delivery and it was picked up 6 days ago - not sure how long it would take to get back to Amazon to credit my card.  We are still waiting as it says return started but there is no confirmation of pickup or any easy way to track it online since it’s a private 3rd party company which is concerning.  That experience will determine if we order a replacement via Amazon or Costco.The picture was good, set up easy through Samsung app that we had to download.  The remote is weird/wonky and the interface is kind of clunky.  I don’t love that. Though to use remote to get back to channel guide/source.  But if you are familiar with newer Samsung products it will probably come naturally to you.  We just found it not very intuitive.",

    "The remote is subminimalist. Using the remote to turn on the tv then requires several steps to choose the input source, the particular app then requires an override of the default channel. The tv overrides the memory of the cable box.The screen shows more glare than any tv I’ve owned for several decades.",

    "Nature programs are a joy to watch on this tv. The initial setup was a bit frustrating but totally worth the results!",

    "Remote doesn't have lighted buttons. Put a dot of glow in the dark nail polish on important buttons. It helps when watching in the dark. Mute icon does not go away when gaming with headphones. Smart menu cannot fully be arranged to put you're favorites first. You must scroll to the end. Overall great picture and stock sound. Worth the price. Purchase a quality screen cleaner for this tv.",

    "I have been wanting a larger TV for years and finally got the money to buy one.  My Brother recommended this one and for the price, it has been fantastic.  I can now read the CC on the screen and the description of programs on the DVR.  The only drawback is the lousy sound and I bought an inexpensive sound bar to improve that feature.  I love it.",

    "Don't think I've ever had such mixed feelings over an Amazon purchase.Nutshell; Pro- Great pictureCon- The worst user interface I have ever experienced. And it's not even close!!!Having different brand TV's before has given me the opportunity to compare it to many different brands. Like all Samsung products, they ruin everything they touch by overthinking.The amount of pure garbage you have to go through, just to watch tv for the first time is mind boggling.Yes, all smart TV's require a first time set up. But no other tv I have seen requires all this non essential garbage.All other tv brands, you select picture, then there is a drop down, Brightness, contrast, color, tint, etc... Then underneath that is advanced picture settings. Does Samsung do that? Nope.If you want to access advanced picture settings you actually have to leave picture settings. Huh?Why wouldn't you put advanced picture settings underneath regular picture settings? You know, like every other brand does. That was rhetorical. I don't even care what their answer would be.Let's put it somewhere else, and make it next to impossible to find.Listen, if you have had a Samsung tv before, then your probably gonna do just fine.After having it for 90 yrs, you probably have it all figured out it by now.But if you are not technically proficient, please find another brand.This is NOT a good choice for most regular people.The frustration I'll save you will be worth it. You should not have to go through 75 'what were they thinkinig',moments when setting up and using a new tv. It should be fun. Exciting.Also, the remote has only a few buttons. I caught on quickly, but many will not. It will be truly frustrating. Like others have said, it's a nightmare!Oh, but it has a pretty nice picture.Only,so do other brands.....................",

    "Just over a year old.  The TV is in an extra bed room that hardly was used.  Suddenly it won’t turn on.",

    "My 47 LG 3D from 2016 finally needed to be taken out back. After extensive research and much agony, I decided to go with the SAMSUNG 55-Inch Class Crystal 4K UHD AU8000 Series. The tv is large but not too large. Cost certainly was a factor, but the Samsung brand proved to be the deciding factor since I love Samsung brand cellular phones the most. I was not disappointed! After several months I decided write a review. The picture quality is absolutely amazing. I've had a smart TV before - just not this smart! Could not be happier with this purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a step up without breaking the bank.",

    "My nephew loved that tv",

    "We put the volume to 100 when on our previous smart tv we always had it at 17-18. We don’t like the volume at all.",

    "I have Internet wifi but I connect to TV via an antenna. Somehow it figured this out and gave access to scores of other channels, too. Amazing!",

    "Buena compraEs mejor de lo que pensé mucho mas delgada y la imagen super nitida ya con esta son 3 samsung smart tv que compro y son lo mejor de lo mejor ",

    "I was very excited to purchase this new large screen Samsung Smart TV.  But when I opened the box my disappointments started.1. Box does not include bolts for wall mounting.  You need four M8-1.25 x 20mm bolts to attach the TV to the mounting bracket.  Because they are metric, they are not easy to find.  After 2 hours of 2 trips to Home Depot I was ready to finally mount the TV on the wall.  If the manufacturer could just add $3 worth of bolts, it would have saved me 2 hours in installation.2. When you start setting up TV, first thing it does it asks you to install a Samsung app on your phone.  Then it asks you to create a Samsung account.  I didn't want to create the account - just wanted to watch TV.  But now 2.5 hours in I went with it.  Creating account didn't work because email verification message just didn't come.  That wasted another hour.  Then I said OK, I'll just setup with a remote without account.3. It started asking me about my cable provider which is Optimum in my cases but it wasn't listed in the choices and on-screen prompts were so convoluted that I was ready to smash the remote into the wall before I got past this setup step.4. Connected to my Wi-Fi and started downloading updates - TV said it will take 32 hours, so I abandoned this process too.So finally after 4+ hours of truly frustrating experience I've my TV on the wall working just as smart as my grand-mothers TV from 1990 - see the picture, change volume.I am going to send it back and get an LG or some other brand.  This TV was a disaster from the moment I opened the box.  And I and a very tech savvy and handy person.",

    "They need to improve on the sound quality.",

    "Don't buy this has a horrible remote and UI and I don't like it. Please work on the UI; hire frontend engineers and for the remote too.",

    "TV seems new but YouTube search screen had some prior history as if the TV was used and returned.  overall quality not bad for price range.",

    "The TV is fine, but starting a few months ago, YOUTUBE TV app has been having issues.This goes for ANY Samsung tv product. I also heard QLED too?I'm so frustrated w Samsung and YT/TV, that i'm buying another brand.So buyer beware if you're using YT/TV. Only works about 60% of the time.",

    "TV has excellent picture quality. Sometimes it seems as though you reach out and touch the picture it is so realistic looking. It was easy to setup, connected to wifi was simple also. Highly recommend this TV.",

    "This tv is terrible. I will never buy another tv from Amazon",

    "Okay for that price. Sound and picture quality could be better. You will definetely need a sound bar if you want to enjoy movies or sports. There is no sleeping timer on this TV, which is disapointing in 2022.",

    "This is a great tv for the price for me it has great picture quality very thin profile great for our master bedroom.",

    "This is a tv that we use in the room, mainly for streaming. The image quality is good, the speakers are heard well although the sound is average. But the operating system is disappointing, it takes time to execute commands, it hangs for a few seconds sometimes. The remote works fine, but the battery cover keeps falling off.",

    "Delivered and installed for free with Amazon prime!  Fantastic picture and only one remote needed.  Absolutely love this!",

    "Wow what a good picture!",

    "This was a gift for my son.  He is very happy with the tv but did need to go into the settings and make adjustments.  He is amazed at the smart features and all the perks that came with it.",

    "For the price range is the best option",

    "This TV had two really bad dead pixels which were like white dots and one was about 1/4”. When you watch a show it is all you see and you find that it is all you focus on. Hopefully this was just a defective unit but I am not buying another Samsung",

    "Oh...mah gawd. I upgraded Netflix to 4k just for this bad boy, as well as buying a slew of 4k DVDs, a 4k dvd player, and regret none of it. It's almost creepy it looks so good. Easily handles 4k/60fps for super smooth and beautiful picture quality. I highly recommend not dropping a corner on your foot like I did or expect a huge bruise for a couple of weeks. Like no joke, half of my foot was swollen and most of my toes were out of commission. I don't care how badass you think you are, this is a two person job.Really happy with the feet that come with the TV. Super sturdy and sit perpendicular to the TV instead of that weird Y shape that looks like Bruce Lee showing off by doing push ups with his thumb and index finger.The remote is OK, very simple and streamlined which fits the design of the software to the TV since everything is controlled with 1 or 2 programs and under lists of commands within said programs. Easily runs any app you could want and being samsung it has access to paramount+ and discovery+ which has been a problem with my LG TV. I guess there's always roku but screw that. In this age of streaming why do we need a peripheral to do what the main hardware should. It's not like we live in the 80s/90s where you need a separate: cd player, vhs player, speaker system, TV, cable box, and DVD player... I kinda miss those tv/vhs/DVD combos, maybe one day again.It's a TV, buy it if you want one.",

    "I purchased this TV August 2021 and fast forward to October 2022, I now have a faulty screen. I blame myself for not assuring I added additional warranty coverage when I made my purchase and now I have to purchase another TV. In addition to the black shadow that has engulfed my TV screen, the smart features and/or processors on this unit are beyond slow. Simple commands take ions to process and sometimes you click the wrong app because of the lag. Then there’s the constant audio battle when connecting to my surround sound, I often have to disconnect and reconnect in order for it to work. The remote is made of paper mache, the clips that hold the battery cover on, broke after one slight fall and now I have to tap the remote or else the battery cover just  slides off. AND TO PUT THE CHERRY ON TOP - Samsung “Pro care” is far from professional, I have been given the run around and they outsource repair techs that don’t confirm appointments nor do they answer their office phone. Overall, this has been an utterly bad experience with the device and the manufacturer.Update (11/12): officially filed a ticket with Samsung Pro on Oct 13, and the issue has yet to be resolved. On my latest call, I was informed their was an error with my ticket, which has caused the extreme delay for replacement. Overall horrible experience and I’m still with out a TV a month later",

    "The picture is great but my 10 year old Samsung had a much better speaker. I bought one of those audio bars hoping that this will solve the problem.That's why 4 stars instead of 5.The sound bar works fine. I wonder if the lousy speaker was intended to increase their sales of sound bars.",

    "The picture and the smart features are great, but the sound is poor. It is very difficult to understand voices when there is background music. There is no sound frequency volume adjustment, only master volume. You end up turning the volume up and then you are overwhelmed by the background music. The picture is great. The smart features are very good. The remote takes a little to get used to, but is pretty good. Expect to by a fairly good sound bar to go with this TV.",

    "Great TV especially for the money. Not all the bells and whistles but enough. Remote is terrible but we use a Roku so it doesn't matter.",

    "This TV is oven better than expected. The picture is better than all other TVs in my house!  The color is also wonderfully vivid.",

    "This is a very new purchase a week later this is the problem I'm having. Will be returning for a new item",

    "I might need to adjust a setting but any dark scenes look bizarre.  You can see the CGI, etc, and this unit came with slight ghost edges I can tolerate.",

    "Speakers are not great. Picture is okay but not first in class.",

    "This TV is the biggest piece of junk I’ve ever owned!  The audio from the built in speakers is terrible. The Wi-Fi receiver in the unit will not connect more than half of the time unless the Bose Solo 5 is taken from the shelf and place directly in front of the TV , and then it still takes at least three to four times of attempts to connect.  Each corner of the screen has a “glow” to it that effects the black/dark scenes. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TV AT ALL!!",

    "I bought the TV for my Grandma and she watches a lot of older shows. Somehow even though they're in black and white they look like they were filmed in 4k, crystal clear and it seems to have depth.",

    "It stopped working after 7 months. Technician came to repair the tv. Caused damage when opening the tv. Then blamed me saying it was damaged. Voided the warranty. No recourse. Customer service very poor. Don’t buy they don’t stand by their product. Blames the customer for repair technician error. Poor product",

    "Love my Samsung TV. Easy set up.",

    "Never buying another Samsung product.",

    "I love the picture quality and easy to use. The remote takes some getting used to as it does t have all the buttons others have. But I can set all my streaming services without issue and it’s easy navigate to them.",

    "The picture quality is perfect easy to use the remote.love my new TV",

    "Salio dañada no se mira solo rallas blancas aparecenNo sirve salio dañada",

    "Great 43 inch",

    "Bought this from a box store when my 10 year old Vizio quit.  It works good for watching broadcast signals but IT IS AWFUL for watching movies on Amazon Prime Video.  The picture is so dark you're basically just staring at a black screen.  I have spent hours reading, troubleshooting and trying solutions to no avail.For Netflix turning off HDR helped.  For DirectTV the picture is fine.It is totally unusuable with Prime Video and Prime Video will NOT let you scale down (HDR to SDR) to fix the problem.  There are hundreds of complaints about this online and Amazon Prime Video doesn't seem to care.Its a mix of a problem, perhaps some on Samsung's part and some on Amazon Prime Video's part but the bottom line is this television does not work with Prime Video movies, the screen is just black.",

    "I can't believe that I waited 15yrs to purchase a new TV!  Especially since I used to sell LG, Samsung, Sony, and several other brands of TVs just a few years ago.  Set up was fast, bit of a learning curve to use the remote, which has far less buttons that my Universal Remote. Have had it for just over a week, and I'm as pleased as punch! Awesome picture, sound is pretty good, however, I just purchased a sound bar to make this TV hop!  Samsung provides a bunch of free content, and pairs well with my Roku and Prime accounts to make this a full experience.  I may end up purchasing another one just for my kitchen. That would be cool!",

    "I returned the last tv back to Amazon, I don’t want to mention the brand but after that I decided to try this Samsung TV, I like this tv so far. It’s a good TV.",

    "Great picture, remote is terrible",

    "Great TV.  Picture looks so real.  Very thin so fits nicely on rv cabinet.Would have been great if it came with directions how to use it and list of features!",

    "Unlike most smart TV’s that allow you to download all of the major apps, don’t expect that here. If you like anything that leans wholesome or politically right in the slightest, you won’t be able to download the app on here.  Also, the remote is overly sensitive and the battery cover falls off very easily.  I will never buy another Samsung product",

    "Great picture.",

    "got the vertical bar about 4 inches wide runs top to bottom line of black blue green an black. wont go away, its junked out. 1 year warranty except theres no support for this item. noone to contact.these r some junk junky A tv's man 500 bucks an last 6-7 months. wow.previous same thing lasted four years did the same thing, before that a sony 4 years same thing.theres ur electronics quality nowadays + no support noone to contact. its not amazon they do nothing.",

    "Watching TNF on a fire stick the screen is fine for the most part but when it's fast camera action like on a pass play or alot of action the screen shutters horribly. I have tried adjusting the judder settings but still happens to much",

    "I'm very happy with my purchase.  A great TV all round.",

    "Many problems, everything in general",

    "1 year and 1 month later.  Yesterday a line appeared at the bottom of my screen.  3 dots that created a full line at the bottom.  I'm EXTREMELY UPSET!!!  More than $800.00 for a TV that doesn't even last a YEAR??!!!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING SAMSUNG!!This is ridiculously insulting.  I'm going to reach out to Amazon to see if there is anything that can be done, but I'm not hopeful.",

    "I'm surprised at how tinny the sound is compared to the previous TVs I’ve had.  There is a way to adjust the bass and treble but adjusting it didn’t do any good.  The internal speakers are probably very small. Could buy a sound bar. But honestly I’d prefer to spend that extra money on a better quality TV.  Very disappointed.",

    "The tv is now flickering. Why it’s not even 6 months and it needs repairs? Why!",

    "I dislike the way samsung did not validate the warranty.My TV stop working 1 month before the warranty expired. I called them they gave me a number to call for service. I call them for an appointment they could not give me one they were always busy then they wanted pictures I sent them samsung kept calling me after 4 weeks they canceled my service ticket. After that they told me my tv did not have warranty. It did not matter anything I said. So I don't have a tv now. I guess they sell too many that they don't care.",

    "I mistakenly put a thumb in the screen of my 2020 Samsung TU7000 - 65 inch and heard that dreaded CRACK  The T showed up where my thumb print was  I replaced it with the 2021 AU8000 - 65 Inch and to my surprise it has MUCH DEEPER BLACK than my previous model.  The Black in this TV is AMAZING  IT'S STUNNING how DEEP the Black can get in this TV and almost would seem like it's an LED OR OLED, but It's Not‼️‼️  The UI is a little laggy at times, but it seems to be getting better.  The previous TU7000 remote works with THIS TV  It's half as thin as my previous model with better color in my opinion.  It has to 2 USB ports and 3 HDMI ports (one with eArc).  I purchased it with the Samsung HW-B650 Sound Bar and it Really sounds AMAZING.  THE BASS can get Really Deep when paired thru Bluetooth.  Overall,  It's a Perfect Match for the money.",

    "Dead on arrival",

    "Sometimes the picture  come in cloudy  not very sharp at times. An i seem not to be able to get my local  channels. An the remote should have a light in it to see what your pushing in the dark",

    "Finally settled for this one and got it on sale . so double thumbs up",

    "I've have great luck with Samsung but the speaker must be super small because the sound quality is terrible on this tv",

    "I love this TV because of how clear it it. I have been using it for 5 months now, I bought it for a low price on prime day. No troubles so far with the TV and it so perfect for gaming. Would recommend",

    "Excellent picture and features. Didn't realize how much I needed it until I got it.",

    "My last tv was LG and had terrific sound so disappointed with the sound on this tv. That said, love the tv. Terrific remote,  great picture, and love it being web based and has great apps installed. Will be getting a sound bar and subwoofer. Nothing fancy, just something to improve the tinny, variable sound. Recommend this tv if sound quality is ok with you. Some people aren’t so picky.",

    "I've been loving this TV a ton! I pretty much keep it on 24/7 and I have noticed some dead pixels now in the bottom right corner, I'm really bummed at this but I've heard samsung has a dead pixel problem but refused to believe it.It isn't bad yet but I can only imagine how many more will appear through the months",

    "Listen, the picture is what you want. Get a good blue tooth speaker to pair and you’re there. The remote will be a learning curve-but it’s no Apple TV remote. Buy this TV. Learn the remote, you’ll be good.",

    "This 75 Samsung is replacing my 2009 Panasonic 50 Plasma TV. The Plasma still works great but the living room arrangement required some upgrades and changes.I will cover two things.1. The price for this size TV is great. The shipping and delivery were adequate. They sat the TV box right next to the TV console. The box was undamaged and in good shape. Delivery was supposed to be Sept 28 but I called to see if it could be delivered sooner since the shipping showed it was in my hometown in two days' time. They did deliver it sooner with no issues.2. The TV is so large you need to be careful with it as it will flex a bit but not bad. The TV stand feet were plug in and easy to install. The only two plug ins on the back I needed was the power plug and one HDMI ARC. Since I have all my external components running through a Sony Receiver, I didn't need to set up Samsung's monotonous sign-in register junk. I hate Samsung and all their account joining stuff and private into. They are as bad as Google in that area.  I skipped all that since I have Direct TV, Amazon Fire Stick, a BluRay player, and speaker set-up all through my receiver I had no need to set up any Samsung program. I don't even need the Samsung Remote. But this is just my set-up. So in 4 minutes I was up and running with my old remotes from the other Plasma set-up. No issues.3. Now for the picture quality. Some people are very focused on expert picture quality. Others like a good picture. In this case, the picture quality is more than adequate for normal family viewing. I admit the 'richness' of my plasma colors was a lot better than this Samsung but with a little Brightness, contrast, and sharpness adjustments on this TV, the picture quality is just fine. Even side views aren't bad. I hear that the new OLED screens are better but for everyday viewing and the double price difference, this picture is more than good enough for TV viewing. Very happy with the overall picture quality vs the price of this large TV. Overall I am very happy with the purchase and find the price to quality is just right. How long this TV lasts will be the only question and that will be determined in due time. My old 14-year-old Plasma is still working great so I got plenty of good time with that TV let's hope this one lasts 1/2 that long at least.",

    "It fit perfectly in the space and it was not heavy like older models",

    "Are you serious?  It's 2022 and I can't rewind or fast-forward my tv.Amazing!I hate this tv.",

    "Love the tv!",

    "I love this tv  the picture is amazing . It's the best tv  I have ever had! Thank you samsung",

    "Samsung may own a decent share size of the electronics market in a number of sectors but their products, including this TV/remote are included in useless bloated features, overly complex remote control for no reason and picture quality, while wonderful, provides little in the way of manual control over brightness and contrast. The remote is near useless in providing any intuitive use and having some kind of a “Home Page” for the remote and tv in combination must’ve been created by some troll who never leaves their tv let alone their house. For someone who simply wishes to pick up the remote, and sit down to watch a single show on any cable cutter feature channel (Amazon Video or Netflix), neither Samsung’s native layout of trapping you in their system nor the idiotic remote are helpful in any navigation whatsoever. If it weren’t for the two hot buttons on the remote for Amazon and Netflix I would’ve returned this entire package.Never, ever again buying a Samsung. Samsung anything. Nope.",

    "Own 2 other SAMSUNG's.  This is my biggest and best so far.  BEAUTIFUL",

    "Greatest birthday present for anyone who loves to watch TV a lot and see a crystal clear picture.  Love all the features too.",

    "No",

    "Samsung 55 inch AU8000 TV. Picture is clear crisp sharp 4K quality/resolution and so is watching at a side angle. Can control TV with voice-3 options. I chose Amazon Alexa which is the best. Comes with bunch of popular apps but can add more at App Store. Samsung loves YouTube. I can watch YT channels and all videos in my folders. I have several paid streaming services/ apps. You have to take time to connect them to TV but once you do everything runs seamlessly. TV remote is smartly designed and is small with very few buttons to push and so simple to use. Speakers are excellent with a deep base. I was surprised of the high sound quality from this super thin skinny TV. You also get Samsung TV Plus built-in with lots of additional free content. Delivery service was great so I tipped the two guys that delivered it. If you've read this far I think it's clear that I highly recommend this model.",

    "I love this television it is absolutely fantastic. The only thing I would say is the box is it clear that if you cut the tape you can lift the box off of the bottom. So I didn’t know this and getting it open was a fiasco.",

    "Liked everything",

    "Remote stopped working after using a month",

    "I typed the website onto my phone it was displayed on the screen to sign in and instead it takes me to Google search page. After over a half hour I decided I was done with a smart features of this very stupid TV. Oh and there's no audio jack unless you have digital in speakers . The sound on this  thing  leaves me thinking . The speaker box from a 70's phone sounds better. Think they did this so someone would buy a Samsung sound bar . Jokes on them .I'm using a Jam speaker BTW it sound 10 times better then Samsung's built in sound.  The remote is a joke the minimalist  design left me grabbing  my old Samsung tv remote . Got this for my 85 year old mom good luck with that , she, ok everyone, need a remote with buttons . I'm a techy and even I had issues with this POS. TV.",

    "TV itself is great, arrived intact and was easy to setup. Amazon “delivery” that was included was useless - I was promised an in-person setup to ensure the TV was intact (not guaranteed based on other reviews). Not only did the delivery team never contact me, they left the TV at the wrong building so I spent all day thinking they’d never delivered at all. Good product, horrible service from Amazon.",

    "Have had this TV for over 8 months. LOVE this TV, yet to have any issues. Samsung I have issues with but the TV itself is great. FYI - HBOMax and Samsung have some beef with each other and it is common for Samsung TV's to glitch when watching HBOMax",

    "Great TV! I really like it A LOT! BUT.....I'm thankful I have a sound bar! The sound on this TV is AWFUL! It does not match the beautiful picture!! I do recommend the TV but buy a sound bar with it!!!",

    "The main reason I got this specific TV is because it claimed to be Google compatible. That is obviously a blatant lie as I am completely unable to Cast or mirror my phone screen from any app or round about method I have attempted, even though both the TV and phone are connected to the same WiFi. Total waste of money on my end.",

    "Very frustrating to set up and time consuming.",

    "Mediocre product/customer service. I cannot recommend this project. One day I turned on the television and there were horizontal and vertical blue and white line around the perimeter of the screen on both sides and the bottom of the screen. When I looked closer, I could see light from from the top of the frame coming out and the screen surface popping out of the frame itself. I registered my product so I looked up the warranty, which I had an email confirmation for, and found that the website doesn’t recognize my account, or my model #. Additionally, the website says my product isn’t registered even though I have an email from Samsung saying so. I tried chat, phone, and email support, and was transferred via chat three times, sent to a different department 2x because the automated phone assistant could not decipher between “Samsung monitor” and “Samsung tv”, and then was transferred via chat to a link that sent be back to the beginning. Needless to say, the product and customer service are incredibly unsatisfactory. The voice technical call system is highly unstable and constantly disconnects and the customer service reps cannot hear the responses. When it asks you if you want an auto callback and you decline, it signs you up automatically. The whole system is incredibly faulty and very unstable. I think my appreciation for Samsung products just wore out.",

    "I bought this TV in the last year to replace another Samsung that I had had for quite a number of years. It is working well so far and has great picture quality. I have Roku and the only thing I don't like is that it takes sometimes a bit of time for the Roku to come up full screen. The TV's menu will still be showing at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise it is fine.",

    "Don't waste your money or time with this model. We bought the 55 inch model. Set up was horrible, there are 4 stages of set up and the unit was stuck on stage 3 for hours. You cannot skip apps you don't want or need.So, after listening to music for a combined 3-4 hours and watching television programs for no more than 3 hours, over the course of 4 days, the tv screen went black and shut off. Checked the power, all connections - everything is fine. The tv is dead. After reading numerous reviews on line, I should have known better than to order a new Samsung. We have 4 other Samsungs, between 4 and 6 years old which work great, including 2 Samsung sound bars which are outstanding.Samsung's quality has gone down significantly. I will be returning this tv immediately.",

    "Not a bad TV for the $$. Pretty easy to set up. I run a couple of devices thru it and haven't had any issues yet.",

    "I have never been disappointed by Samsung televisions. They are the best as far as I'm concerned. The only issue I had was during the setup it got stuck at a specific step and wouldn't continue. A quick Google of the problem found the way to resolve it. I recommend this TV for sure",

    "No manual!",

    "Fine picture, Amazon guys did a great job installing it *****.  On the down side it's only ports are HDMI, and as far as I can tell they're all inputs - no outputs, though it does look like it has an optical audio output.The remote sucks, few buttons no words only icons.  Pro Tip - if you are replacing a Samsung with this try your old remote!  Mine works with it and is *much* easier.  Oh - and the 'user manual' is useless.On the plus side the picture is great, and I'm happy to have access to the Samsung Plus Smart TV wireless channels which my old one did not.",

    "So the tv recently updated itself. Ever since then the volume will not work until I press and hold the power button and boom volume back to normal. Then the next day again, no volume. Samsung needs to fix their updates. Besides that, great tv",

    "It seems like this item was an open box or display because it’s enclosure was damaged and the seal tape was broken",

    "Very disappointed in this TV.  Sound is horrible and keeps disappearing.  Have to unplug and reset.  Picture clarity is not good, brightness and contrast keep fading in and out.  Horrible.  Very disappointed and too late to return it.",

    "Easy setup. Great picture.",

    "Tv will regularly stop playing sound. It takes turning it off for 30 seconds to 1 minute in order for sound to work again.",

    "Has a beautiful picture. Really like the options that come with the remote control and the program that it comes with. Very bright picture and very good sound. The only thing I don’t like so far is there’s not a sleep mode for it or at least I can’t find it. Would be nice if you could shut off after you fall asleep.Happy I got it. Thank you",

    "The return was a bit of a hassle. Got the same TV at local store for $50 more. Picture quality is amazing. Remote works seamlessly with Directv Netflix and Amazon prime video",

    "Deep shadows after just a few months.  Unwatchable.  Amazon says outside 30 day window - and Samsung support is a maze of friendly but completely useless people.  What a joke",

    "Perfect tv for my living room",

    "Incredible picture. Overall I have no complaints.  Easy to navigate and dwnld. apps. Would buy again, thinking of getting my husband one for his garage!",

    "I am so pleased with this tv. The picture is so real.",

    "Exelenterecomendado 100%",

    "Great TV for the price.  Peripherals connect easily.  Smart functions work well",

    "The remote, dislike, picture quality excellent!",

    "I am so satisfied with this TV I am having a hard time finding the words to express my level of satisfaction, believe me this is what you want when you buy a large screen TV.",

    "This tv has a beautiful picture, set up was easy and it has everything o want in a tv however the sound is not good. I returned one of these tv’s alittle over a month from when I purchased it because the sound started to crackle really bad. Very noticeable. Amazon was awesome with the return. Got the new one within days but tonight it started crackling as well.  I’m super bummed I do like this tv but I can’t handle the sound.  I thought it might just be from one of my streaming apps but it’s on my xfinity also.  So it looks like I’ll have to choose a different brand.  Very disappointed",

    "The TV itself is aesthetically pleasing with a pretty good picture! Unfortunately, the sound quality is horrible. I don't even have a good ear for what acoustics are supposed to sound like and have never bothered to purchase a sound bar with any of my previous TVs because it has never mattered to me...but this sound quality is so poor that anyone would notice. I was hoping that maybe the sound was being muffled from the protective plastic around the TV or the fact that I don't have the TV raised off of my console enough, but after taking off the plastic and raising the TV higher off of the TV stand, nothing has changed. If anyone knows of something I'm missing, please reach out to me! Otherwise, I will likely be returning for this reason.Also wanted to mention that you have to change the volume at least  +/- 10 to notice any difference from the previous volume. And lastly, as others have mentioned, the remote control is very small and leaves a lot to be desired.",

    "As you can see from the picture, the FIRST TV I was sent was not an acceptable product. And honestly, I believe they sent this shattered screen one on purpose because I called & complained about a delivery hold up, so I believe they just grabbed a broken one & threw it on the truck because I suddenly & very quickly got it like the next day, strangely enough. Even more strange was that the two capable gentlemen who delivered this one had it strapped securely to the inside rear of the truck with absolutely nothing around it (in an empty 10ft radius) nothing that could've damaged it so badly, & these guys were not reckless or dropsy, so I'm still not sure how a TV shipped & handled that securely got shattered across the entire front of the screen while being handled by such careful pros. Thankfully the replacement was much better and I received a free, DELUXE DELIVERY & UNBOX which was a very misleading thing because when they got here w/ the TV, the young gentleman in charge continually explained how they could do nothing but take it out of the box, plug it in and ensure operation, which amounted to making sure it turned on, and then take the box and leave. That's it, that's all! They literally wouldn't even help me lift it onto the table where it was to sit. I still don't know what was DELUXE about this Deluxe Delivery & Unbox. Oh, & the same guy complaining about all they couldn't do for me instead of focusing on what he could do? He also had to (quite annoyingly) repeatedly tell me that they weren't even supposed to deliver to you because of the construction going on in what used to be our apt bldg's parking lot. Yet Amazon delivers here practically everyday. But for some strange reason he was insistent that the construction out front was a definite No No for Amazon deliveries (or maybe he meant just for TV deliveries). I'm stil not sure. Either way, still makes no sense.So now to the TV. I ordered this 65 Samsung Crystal Tizen for TWO MAIN REASONS.1) It had a voice remote & 3 voice assistants to choose from, but since I like Google & they were pushing this as a Google TV w/ Google Assistant, that was a big selling point for me. Actually the biggest selling point. I knew I could very easily connect my already established Google Assistant like I had done on a 4K Chromecast I bought from Walmart in 2020. But sadly, THAT NEVER HAPPENED! After speaking extensively to Samsung TV support, Google & Google Assistant support, Amazon support, & even some support chat bots & emails & community support forums & you name it, I tried it. The best advice I got to simply move forward from this nightmare fiasco was to go ahead & just use one of the other two remaining voice assistants that were still available on the TV, Samsung's Bixby, or Amazon's Alexa.  Both of which I dislike. What I had seen of Samsung's Bixby from interaction with it on my Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets was that it was fully advertisement saturated, and I dislike that immensely. Whereas Amazon's Alexa is just one big speaking algorithm designed primarily for nothing more than selling more Amazon merchandise. I don't need that on my TV remote & I'm also not buying another device to connect to it just to get it to work properly with the TV. Because of course if you select Alexa as your voice assistant they immediately try to upsell you into an Echo or some other unnecessary thing you don't need to operate a voice assistant on your TV remote. Why do I need another device to make my TV remote work correctly with a voice assistant? I've been using Roku voice remotes for 3 or 4 yrs now & they work just fine w/ their system as is. No extra device purchase necessary. My Google Chromecast works amazingly well with its Google Assistant voice remote. Both of those items were less than $100 each. Buuuut, a brand new 65 4K Samsung Crystal Tizen has the WORST voice assistant remote I've ever encountered. And it WILL NOT HOOK UP TO GOOGLE ASSISTANT.  So, on to the . . . .2nd REASON I PURCHASED THIS TV?Because it had 4K UPSCALING!!! What a huge feature in a TV this inexpensive! I'd purchased a Sony Blu-ray player w/ 4K upscaling and it was amazing. I fell in love with how old DVD movies were brought up to nearly 4K quality with doing nothing more than putting the movie in the carriage and pushing play. So when I saw that this Samsung Crystal Tizen had 4K upscaling in all picture viewing formats, BOOM, I was all in. That 4K upscaling & the 4K picture clarity in it's Dynamic viewing mode have been the ONLY redeeming qualities in this entire fiasco of a purchase.Talk about a bunch of ridiculous false advertising, pitiful customer support & delivery inadequacies, & more difficulty & flawed merchandise than one person should have to endure in an entire year? But of course these are all avoidable issues that I somehow created on my own when I clicked, Add to cart & made a purchase, fully believing & trusting that i was going to receive what i had read & saw with my own eyes, in the time i was told I'd receive it.(Speaking of, did I mention the reason I called and complained about the delayed shipping to begin with was that my item, the broken TV in the picture, had been sitting in a little suburb about 20 minutes outside of town for going on 2 days and had not moved according to the tracking details? Which is why i personally believe that when I called to inquire about it, that my inquiry was taken as a slight & perturbed the heck outta whomever received it & because of it, this broken mess is what they sent me. Nearly 2 days in one spot 20 mins away from me? What would you do?)Oh, & apparently I'll never have Google Assistant on this TV. It just won't connect. Keeps telling me to login & connect but won't let me. I've been FORCED to use Samsung's Bixby as the voice assistant for the TV & remote. UGGGHHHHH!!!IN CLOSING - ITS A GOOD TV FOR THIS PRICE, BUT IF THEY RAISE THE PRICE? LOOK ELSEWHERE. AND REMEMBER, THE ONE FEATURE YOU'RE PERSONALLY AFTER? THE ONE FEATURE THAT MAY BE THE SELLING POINT THAT SOLD YOU ON THIS TV? IT'S HIGHLY POSSIBLE IT MAY NOT WORK AT ALL, OR MAY NOT WORK CORRECTLY. It's also a very high possibility that if you run into shipping and delivery issues, you can end up with a broken TV and have to do a long & painstaking, time consuming, long time waiting for your money back, refund and return. Yay Amazon & Samsung!(What follows is an addendum to my review (11/16/22)THE REMOTE.......? Worst remote I've ever used. And I am not saying that lightly. Most remotes are pretty ergonomic and you can adapt to them easily, although sometimes it may take a while to get accustomed to it. This remote? It's been months and I still fumble with it. For one, it's much to small & thin. My biggest gripe about it, though, is that I often watch videos inside of streaming apps. And the main problem w/ the remote here is when you push the PLAY/PAUSE button? Every third or fourth time (sometimes several times in a row if your tired or absent minded) you will mistakenly also push the channel selector button which is right below it. So this obnoxious channel guide button on the remote? It's placement & size makes it stick up off the remote face much too high, so it's very easy to accidentally graze it w/ your thumb when clicking the PLAY/PAUSE button. Which then immediately takes you out of the video you were watching, closes that app and switches the input over to the TV channels. And this happens frequently. I cannot overstate this. Because, after all, what button do you use more frequently on your Smart TV remote than the PLAY/PAUSE button? Can you imagine how annoying it is to REPEATEDLY have to log back in to an app to finish watching a movie that you should only have to push PLAY on the remote to finish? Or how startled you REPEATEDLY are when the TV channels suddenly pop on in a LOUD COMMERCIAL when you were merely pushing the PAUSE button on the remote so you could go fix a soda in the kitchen while the movie was in a slow spot? And to have this happen every 3rd or 4th time you press that PLAY/PAUSE button on the remote? And don't think it's because I'm thick fingered or ignorant. I'm a guitar player & artist with extremely nimble & dexterous digits, so it's not me!So if you decide to get this TV, maybe seriously consider a different remote. Don't get me wrong, I love my Samsung TV. It's a huge step up from that 65 4K TCL/Roku piece of crap I bought from Walmart in Oct 2020 that died on me TWICE & went into the black screen of death. And all before 2021 was through. A TV that barely makes it over a year before it dies twice? Yeah, that's a bad TV. This is a much better product and I am much happier. And I don't know what TCL Roku thinks UHD or 4K looks like, but that wasn't it. Looking at the clarity on that junky old TCL ROKU TV was like the difference in looking at a muddy puddle compared to looking at clear water, and this Samsung is the clear water. So, I am pretty satisfied w/ the TV itself. It's mainly the delivery process, the unclear definition of what a deluxe delivery and unbox means, the process required to return a broken TV and get a replacement, The Voice Assistant issue which I had massive problems with, and this piece of you know what remote.I would also like to highlight the fact that I finally figured out what the problem was with the Google Assistant. There is a small setting way off in an almost undisclosed area of the SmartThings settings (on your phone or device) for those of you who use Samsung products, and in that setting you have to delete and reset your Google Assistant. It was very hard to find and I only found it randomly and by chance. And I'm telling you this because I went through EVERY setting in SmartThings AND Google Assistant trying to find the problem with why Google Assistant would not connect on this TV. I WENT THROUGH ALL THOSE SETTINGS MULTIPLE TIMES and never saw this until one day I randomly came across it. And it is not easy to find, so I'm not even going to try and explain how to get there. Hopefully you'll find it on your own. But I'll tell you now, it is not an easy setting to find. It does not tell you about this setting ANYWHERE and not a single Tech or help agent was able to direct me in the way I needed to go to fix this so the TV would work with Google Assistant. It stands to reason that one would think this is something that would automatically configure on its own so that your systems would Jive together. But it does not. So, yes, I was finally able to get Google Assistant to operate correctly on this TV. If you have Google Assistant set up on something other than this TV, say a Chromecast or in the SmartThings app on a Samsung smartphone? You will need to reset it and go into every setting and reconfigure it to get it to work with this TV. Hope this helps someone not to suffer and struggle through the nightmare I endured here. But after all's been said and done, I AM VERY HAPPY with my purchase and very satisfied with the reasonable price. I just wish the service had been more helpful and thorough with instructions and directions & just good general customer support. But, all that aside? I got a great TV for a very fair and reasonable price . I'm very satisfied with my purchase even though it has taken me literally months to work out these goofy little kinks that should have been fixed on day one.Thank you for the awesome Samsung TV, Amazon! (Please make them restructure this remote!)",

    "I've had this TV a few months now, and it is the worst TV I've ever had in my life. The user interface is impossible to use. The screen has a bunch of stuff you will never use. And its hard to see what is selected, and hard to figure out where you are in the system. The remote control is stupid. I want to throw the whole thing out the window.Connecting a Mac via HDMI, forget it. I spent hours trying to connect it, using 3 different Macs. No luck on any of them. My 10 year old Panasonic this replaced connected to the same 3 machine in 5 seconds.Connecting a Mac via Airplay is also super bad. I got it to work one time, but it was so choppy it was unusable. After that time, it does not even connect anymore.Everything is hard to use, you will get frustrated using it. I'm a tech savvy person and have been around computers for 30 years. This thing is just bad. Stay away. I'll never, EVER, buy a Samsung TV again.",

    "The video quality is great.Easy to setup.Good set of available apps Airdrop doesn’t work.PC-TV option doesn’t play most apple videos.Buffering constantly even in a symmetric 1GbpsThe remote control is super clunky and can use an upgrade.The keyboard for searches and such is super slow to respond.First day review. Will update later.",

    "voice command does not work, cannot re set to factory settings, very dark screen even with all the brightness turned up, very blurry picture and cannot see anything in the background.Cant return without a box--dont throw your box away, you will not be able to return.So done with amazon, all the stuff lately is broken, defective, or just the wrong item",

    "I bought a brand new tv and it turned on like this when it was delivered to the house, too much trouble and wasting my time",

    "Have had this just a few weeks, it is hard to say anything but good about this product.  Picture is terrific, physical installation was easy (very light 48 pounds) and so thin I could hardly believe.  I am technology challenged.  Thus, I was lucky that my high tech son was available.  I would have been very challenged by the tech setup and might feel deferentially about this TV.  I would likely given up and hired someone to do it.  This is not a problem with the TV, but could be frustrating unless you are tech savvy.",

    "Love my new TV. If you like better sound you will need a sound bar. A Bose works great. The picture is great. The remote is super easy to use. The monthly payments made it super easy to buy as well. Very happy.",

    "Read the one-star reviews saying not to buy since many arrived cracked.  Since this had over 10,000 reviews and a 4.5 star rating, I figured those were outliers.  Maybe not.There was small dent on the left side of the box below the handle.  Otherwise the outer box was undamaged.  Some other minor wear/tear on the box, but nothing significant.Followed the unwrapping instructions and... you could instantly tell something was wrong with the screen.  Cracked in top right corner, an upside-down V across the screen.  Two giant air pockets and some smaller ones.Tried to plug it in and turn on to see how bad it was, but it wouldn't even turn on.  Working on a refund.  Very disappointed.  Should have listened to the one-star reviews.  Ordering a TV online is not worth the risk.",

    "I was pretty excited to get this TV.Heading into my junior year of college, I moved out of the dormitories and into a separate house so I could have my own space. I got the AU8000 on sale around Christmas for a really good deal, and in-store it looked fantastic. Sharp picture, great colours, I was amped I was going to have that eye-popping picture in my room. Then I got it.Good lord, what a let down. Aside from winning the panel lottery (this is the cleanest screen no DSE or vignette in the corners), everything is tough. If it isn't HDR quality video, it looks horrendous. SDR is blocky and you see individual pixels moving around like ants on an anthill. The SDR picture quality is awful, motion handling is terrible even in HDR (whole sections of the panel block out if objects are moving too quickly and watching baseball is like seeing triple), and the ghosting and backlight bleed makes certain movies unwatchable. The banding is so distracting that the HBOMax loading screen is like a rainbow of purple shades. The only app that actually delivers the picture quality I had expected is YouTube on true 4k videos.This was an absolute wash, and it's made me incredibly hesitant to get another Samsung. The UI is fine, (there's nothing special about it and the forced ads are a little annoying) and the game mode is actually great at providing clean picture and good motion with popping colours, so I can't understand why the streamed services are so unbelievably bad. Having the ability to control it from my phone has also been a plus because I've left it on while leaving the house to go to class more than once.I would love to put this down to a defective unit. When I lived with my parents we had a Samsung Qled that was terrific. But I've fiddled with every setting, and when I went to send it back i was informed the dithering wasn't a defect and that the unit was performing as intended. Just save your money.I've had this tv now for over a year, and while I know that having a tv is a luxury, I am completely comfortable saying that I have suffered through it while I save because I can't even sell it with the the marketplace already flooded with other people trying to get rid of their own. I've seen the new TCL 6-series in person and it's impressive, so I'm shooting for that while it's down around $600, and even the equivalently-priced LG UHD models provide superior quality and better black levels. I've just given up on this TV. A year of use and nothing but strained eye-sight to speak about.",

    "Finally set the tv up. Nice screen. I set up the Amazon Alexa feature, not bad, but you do have to use the remote control microphone to work it. I’m still learning the different functions, so far, it’s pretty user friendly. I am not mechanically inclined, but with the weight, I wouldn’t recommend a wall mount. My Apple TV box is pretty useless at this point since the tv offers the same functions. I would definitely buy this on sale again.",

    "Works well, great value.  Looking forward to watching some football on the deck this Fall",

    "This is an excellent TV It is crystal clear The remote is a little smaller than I would like but overall the TV is excellent",

    "Malisima peligrosaLa compré todo bien por 4 meses y sali una mancha y después ido corto y solto quimicos de uno son toxicos para la familia ,,tube que llamar a los bomberos y casi se kema mi casa,,tengo ,,no la compren difinirivamente porfabor,, Samsung debe de responder por esto!!!",

    "Tv has white spots on the top of the screen....feels like a refurbished TV rather than new....has scratches on the back as well. Already tossed the box and don't feel like returning to recieve another damaged TV.",

    "The picture quality is amazing. As with any flat screen, it requires additional speakers. Mine is connected to a 5.1 sound system.Setup was slow and the screens don't give enough feedback about the progress.Some of the remote-control functions are not intuitive. I haven't set up any of the voice commands yet and probably will not.Overall, I have only owned it for a few days, but I love it.",

    "Met my needs. Second time purchasing this television with no regrets.",

    "ExcelenteLa nitidez de la imagen es preciosa",

    "Works well, clean packaging, exterior is sleek and smart features work well for apps, what I expected from Samsung.This isn’t Samsungs top model for picture quality, but it is decent and 4k looks amazing. Sound is decent also, could use a sound bar. The size for a bedroom is solid, TV is light and thin for design.",

    "I like Samsung TVs. The picture quality is good except for when the scene is in the dark. I can put up with that though.",

    "This was my tv for my vacation home, got it and installed it just to realize that it bleeds white light in dark scenes. And it’s just on random spot on the TV. When I called Amazon, they gladly replaced it and just to find out that it’s bleeding light in different spots. I bought 2 and one was perfect but the second one can’t seem to be right even with the replacement it’s still defective. I expect much more from Samsung. Just writing to let buyers know because I know samsung do eat really care about eating because their tv will always sell but there seem to be no quality check. Hopefully someone else don’t get this problem.",

    "Nice tv good picture would recommend",

    "I love the picture quality on this TV, but the sound, I had to put it on amplify to hear it more, since it doesn't have Dolby. But that's a nitpick. I love how I can pair my phone with it in two different ways.",

    "This tv is so nice! The sound quality and the crystal clear picture, I love it! I’m not sure why the other reviews says its not good, but mines have been working pretty well . If your wifi is poor and your using streaming services then the picture will be poor bc it’s buffering ( I think that’s the word) but it’s a really nice tv! Super thin and very sleek looking. Delivery was great also.",

    "This TV is terrible. It's slow and lethargic and puts so much spam and garbage on the screen it takes forever to be able to navigate around. You can't just watch TV and flip through the channels. The TV receiver won't tune in hardly any channels. It's in the trash now because I threw the remote through the screen.Junk garbage don't buy",

    "sound quality not good at times",

    "Straight from the box and powered on with two red lines down the middle of the screen.Just awful!",

    "Great picture and all the streaming apps you’d expect. A bit disappointed that I can’t post pictures through the SmartThings app on my phone to the tv as I can with a different Samsung model, but in general, a great TV for the money.",

    "Love everything",

    "It’s just horrible sound. The picture quality doesn’t seem any better than my other televisions",

    "If you can’t play sound out loud, there’s no aux port, bluetooth is the best bet, right? WRONG. 7 different devices from 5 brands would not show up after hundreds of attempts. a tv that i can’t listen to the audio is completely useless garbage.",

    "I consider myself tech-literate, but this smart tv is just too smart for me.  I have had one heck of a time getting the thing to recognize my firestick and firestick remote.  I even contacted Samsung tech support, only to be told to call Amazon firestick tech support.  I have used firestick for years with no problems.  More than once the tv turns off and won’t turn back on again.  I thought Samsung tvs were tops.  I regret buying it now.",

    "Bought this TV in April 2021. Warranty for 1 year. Today, 8/31/22 the TV stopped working. Worked fine last night and then today you can hear it turn on and off and the picture goes from blue light to black over and over. Called customer service and they didn’t seem surprised with the issue. Had me do a bunch of things and then said sorry it needs to be repaired but you are out of your warranty  window and basically repairs would be as much a new TV. Went online and saw many many other people with the same issue after only about a year.  Won’t ever buy a Samsung again.",

    "So far so good my first Samsung I ever bought so we’ll see compare to my Vizio  I used to buy.",

    "Thank You",

    "From delivery thru easy set up this Samsung TV is a fantastic replacement! Had it programed, it pretty much programs itself and was watching a ballgame in rich clear color quickly. And the number of air channels on this TV is about 30 percent more due to the over the air tuner. Love it!",

    "Love it",

    "A great TV I really enjoy all the smart features",

    "The apps could be a little faster to load, but everything else works exactly as expected.",

    "Purchased thinking I could get local channels. Never could get Samsung plus to work. Samsung help desk could not resolve,",

    "Picture does not seem as good as my previous LG and speaker is definitely very lousy. Sounds like a blown Tweeter from a 1981 K car. Seriously, the speaker is so poor to buy a soundbar just to compensate. Added an instant $250 to the cost of the TV.",

    "One month in all is operating well. Setup was easy.",

    "The Wi-Fi doesn't stay on it keeps stopping in the middle of movies",

    "Estoy muy satisfechoLa resolución  esta por encima de otros moledelos.  Considero que vale la pena la compra",

    "I feel like I can SEE again. I didn't NEED a new TV so I thought but my old LG 43 TV was casting blue when I had it in photographs and video and I needed it it NOT to be blue in a video shoot so I was forced to buy a new TV that doesn't photograph blue. Now that I got this, and it's so bright and crystal clear, I actually want to watch more TV and RE-watch the shows and films that were so dark on my LG. The ONLY thing I don't like better are the FEET on this. They are almost comedic - but more importantly, they are a DISTRACTING shape. They should have been designed with sleekness and low visibility quality. The other issue I've had but am not yet sure it's a TV issue - is the internet connection has frequently gone out on the TV since installation. Maybe something happened with my internet but I've never had this trouble before. Day 2 of it is better so maybe it was just a temp glitch.",

    "Exactly what I thought it would be. Nice big clear screen and quality",

    "It asks for your private information EVERY TIME you turn it on.  I bought a monitor, is nobody's business what shows I watch with it.",

    "Lightweight. Great picture and sound. Great value for price.",

    "Very disappointed. The tv kept blinking and wouldn’t turn off. Had to unplug. Took almost two weeks to get repaired bc of the part needed. Now less than a month the remote features don’t work. Replaced the batteries still nothing. Have to unplug again. Customer service says 10-20 business days for a replacement.  Thought I’d try a new product. But, I’ll NEVER buy another Samsung tv again!",

    "Great picture",

    "You have to set the volume on 100 to get to listen at a comfortable level. What really gets to me is that the voice assistant is louder than the TV so I know that the TV is capable of producing a sound that is good and loud enough. I hooked up Blue Tooth ear phones and it is the same story - volume too low. I'm thinking of return this TV.  My daughter say that this TV sound is  really low when set at 100.  What a shame. Good TV picture but hard to setup and bad sound.This TV has a minimalist remote. No number buttons to enter Channel numbers. The volume up/down and channel buttons are hard to get used to. If you push forward on the button  the volume goes up but when I do that I can’t help but push in on the button at the same time, that mutes/unmutes the TV. This makes it a chore just to change the volume on your TV. As far as I can see there is no info button on the remote or on the TV. I can’t see information about the channel or program I am watching, like the channel number, a synopsis of the program, or whether is is a repeat or new show. Netflix, Amazon Prime and Samsung TV Plus have buttons on the remote but that is not necessary. These buttons will probably be useless by the time the TV is old. Better to have a selection on screen than to have a dedicated hardware button on the remote. Another thing is the house button in the center of the remote, to a screen strip of icons  where you can select Netflix, Amazon Prime,  YouTube and YouTube TV and several others, YouTube TV was on that strip but after I used it a couple of times it disappeared. I thought Smart TVs were supposed to help make it better not worse.If you can find settings on the screen of this TV, with practice, that it takes 16 button pushes to connect a Bluetooth device to this TV, I have to do this several times a day, very annoying. But I have to listen through Bluetooth to make it a comfortable listening experience, The speaker system is not so good on this TV.P. S. I am trying to :”cut the cord ” from Comcast and migrate to YouTube TV. It is a nightmare. This TV makes it hard to access the YouTube TV app.I am trying to get my Alexa to change my Samsung TV to  the MSNBC channel. On my TV screen it sasys that I need to find the Service Provider. Then it leaves me with a choice to Reset all the channels or go away, Alexa sometimes tells me I need to link my Samsung account to Alexa. Alexa says she sent a card to my alexa app but I don;tsee a card.What kind a card is it? I just got off the phone with Samsung. After waiting for a tech for ½ hour,  I had 1 problem and 3 questions  I got the answer to the problem, the tv  doesn’t work that way. One of the questions about the TV was answered. Then she hung up the phone, Very poor service from Samsung.",

    "The best Samsung HD 4k TV I've purchased, great picture, color, and sharpness",

    "The tv seemed nice enough when it worked. But it didn't always work. It would work fine for hours then I would go to use it and it would just have a green screen. All devices, including the cable box would be disconnected. It happened repeatedly the first 3 days I owned it. I researched it and apparently it's a well known problem that has been happening for years. Returns the thing and got an Insignia for $150 less and it's just as nice and actually works. Also hated the remote so much, no return button? Seriously Samsung? Do better, this tv was crappy.",

    "Enjoying all aspects of this tv",

    "This is a GREAT TV, unless you have hearing issues! There is NO headphone Jack on this model. I missed that info when I ordered it. Had to buy a Bluetooth compatible headset..which did not solve the problem at all! This set will NOT help improve your hearing/tv enjoyment experience!!",

    "sound... little weaker than my old 50in.",

    "I recently and regrettably dropped my Samsung UN55H8000 Curved 55-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Smart LED TV (2014 Model) that we use for our bedroom TV (yeah)  anyways the model that is 7 years newer and I get it's on the lower end and the other was supposedly a high end tv.  You'd think curved or flat a tv built 7-8 years older couldn't",

    "the  software keep changing my setting the sound output. I have a stereo amplifier connected to the optical  and software over ride my setting (tv speakers) and keep changing  to optical .",

    "Awesome picture smart features very nice but sound quality lacks robust adjustments and clearing, have to turn up sort of loud to hear and some movies have been so dark that we stop watching. Never experienced that with any other tv before. Needs sound bar.",

    "Excellent.  Easy to connect. Just be sure you remember/have access to all of your passwords.",

    "The picture quality is great. The built in software is slow and buffers constantly. You’ll need to add a Firestick or Roku. Samsung needs to fix their software",

    "Initial review after 3 days: Nice picture.  Very similar to the LG i replaced it with, that i broke.  I like the leg design much more than my LG.  They were easy to put on the TV, and are very sturdy.  The setup through the app is nice, however, it would not accept my Wifi for some reason.  I'm still working on that.  Keeps telling me my password is wrong, and it 100% is not, so that's very strange and annoying.I'll update this later on.",

    "The WiFi card is very weak. Only able to pull 15 mb of speed. Firestick solved my issue pulling 350-400mb",

    "Just received this tv to replace my 6 year old Samsung 4k uhd tv. Unfortunately the sound quality has absolutely plummeted since the last tv I bought. It sounds like someone stuck a cell phone upside down in a solo cup.  Really, really bad. I guess I'm getting a sound bar but I am not happy. And if that doesn't fix it I will be returning this.  It's so bad I can't focus on anything else.",

    "This TV has a pretty good picture but one of the major problems with it is it doesn't get bright enough to consider itself an HDR television. I really wish that Samsung would make these Crystal TVs brighter. I love the fact that the TV is very thin and light and it does have a decent picture and pretty good contrast. But like I said earlier without a higher color gamut and higher knits it will not be sufficient for HDR.",

    "WORKS GREAT THERE IS NI EQUALIZER SETTINGS",

    "Perfect! Clear and a good size.",

    "I like this tv very much. I like that the tv pic is definitely the 65 inch!!",

    "Effortlessly communicates with my laptop and phone. Plug and play!",

    "Purchased the TV 11/14/21.  In July of 2022 we had an issue with a line down the middle and across the TV.  The TV also shut off every few seconds.  We contacted Samsung.  They sent a local company to access the issue.  The issue was with the screen and needed to be replaced - this is after only 7 1/2 months.  They ordered the screen and came back out with the replacement part.  The new screen was installed and now we have lines in different areas of the TV.  They need to order yet another replacement screen.  I would strongly advise anyone interested in purchasing a Samsung especially this model to rethink their decision.  This is the first Samsung I have purchased and this will be my last.  If I could return this - I would.Want to provide an update to this issue - we are now in Oct 2022 and two additional screens have been sent and both were damaged.  Now we are at the point of dealing with Samsung customer service to return this piece of garbage and get our money back.  This has been going on for over a month.  Each time I talk to customer service, I get a different story.  I have asked them to go back and to listen to the calls we have had since they are recorded, since each time I have spoken to them I get a completely different story.  I was originally told I would receive the refund prior to them picking up the TV.  Now I'm told no - I will not see a return until after they collect the TV which I'm sure I will have to continue fighting to get my money.  Their customer service department has hung up on me multiple times.  I would NEVER purchase anything from Samsung.  They do not fix their issues, their customer service is appalling and you will spend so many hours on the phone with them to accomplish nothing.",

    "Great",

    "Great TV, the main issue is it forgets its network status and won't remember or connect until you factory reset. Then it forgets again in a few days. This issue is only on wireless however.",

    "I like being able to watch many of our programs that my family enjoys on a regular basis. Alexa go to you tube! The picture quality is wonderful!! We’re right in the mix being sucked into one of our favorite tv programs.",

    "The care that the delivery drivers took care with this item and the item is heavy so definitely was happy to see that the quality is very good",

    "Very good buy",

    "Great Picture and pretty good sound for in-set.The remote takes a bit of getting used to.  It could use a Home Button or at least a programable one.The on-screen menu set up is pretty obtuse and the setup time is too long because one must hunt around for how this thing works.  The documentation is useless. We use RoKu so don't like the way the set just took that over so we can only use the set's remote not the roku remote which has voice and the Set remote does NOT!  So bear that in mind when adding things like Roku.",

    "Very nice for the money",

    "This products audio went out a week after shaving it. Thankfully I was able to return it but it’s taking forever to get my money back.",

    "Great quality for thus brand and size. Very affordable and great Tv.",

    "We purchased this TV because our Tube TV, that was over thirty years old decided to go into retirement as it was blanking out and showing only a green hue at times. I would have preferred to gone with a bigger TV but this one fit perfectly into our modified entertainment center that held the retired 27 tube TV. We have another Samsung Smart TV, different model; however, it appears that each remote can turn on/off both TVs. After the sets are on, the remote only controls it's connected TV. To get around the on/off issue, we just make sure to turn the remote away from the other TV and that works most of the time. It is a good TV and I recommend it.",

    "The slowest TV ever. Every app takes forever to load. It’s not my network or the internet because every other device works great. It’s just the operating software of this TV that sucks. It’s really slow to switch between apps. And as soon as you turn it on, it starts loading Samsung TV Plus which you cannot delete or remove as default. Just a horrible product altogether",

    "Upon opening the box and setting up the tv I realized the crystal screen was severely cracked! Was returned and refund given BUT - Needless to say disappointed. NEVER buy a tv online!",

    "love the picture",

    "It has a clear picture, almost like you are there. I had to return it as it is defective. Turns on randomly when you have it off. After you turn it on it will automatically change channels and the volume goes up. Searched on line and it appears this brand is known to turn on at random. So I returned it.  To bad it had issues as the picture quality was the best.",

    "This thing is a joke.",

    "Other than the remote being difficult to see and operate, the tv is a great value..After having a freezer delivered to our carport, which is 1/2 mile from house, I had again asked for delivery to front door, both with Amazon and UPS,, that did NOT happen,This did not weigh as much as the freezer, but was cumbersome for a 76 year old man with recent lower back surgery to handle.",

    "Nice tv but not 4k good. I thought picture would match 4k I replaced but no.",

    "I never thought I’d see the day where a TV would come pre-installed with ads that display in your menu and smart hub. Samsung TVs have turned into the lowest quality there is due to software issues bloatware and ads. Skip Samsung and find something better",

    "Great light weight TV for watching sports on the deck with Roku.",

    "I previously purchased a Samsung TU8000 Series TV. I used the buy again feature for another one and they sent me this AU8000 Series, a newer model.The HDR on this model sucks. It's too bright, desaturates everything but red, and isn't as crisp as the TU8000 model. Oh, and the speakers aren't as good.The remote control is better though, much slimmer and easier to remove the back to get to the batteries.The smart UI is the same in both models (smart TV functions are mostly junk like any other smart TV; get a  3rd party device for streaming or use a PC). The AU8000 series has less features once you dig around in the settings compared to the TU8000 series.Buy the TU8000 instead, and NEVER use the Buy Again button! Amazon sends whatever garbage they want to shill.",

    "It showed up broken on the screen. Big crack going down it.",

    "Ive had this TV for about 3 weeks. IVE TRIED SO. HARD. MULTIPLE TIMES.  Im fairly tech savvy.  The TV won't connect to my Bluetooth speaker about 90% of the time. (Although it says its comnected)  I bought an HMDI ARC converter so I could hook my speakers via cable.  Never works.  The sound on the TV without my  speaker sounds like a mouse whispering through cheese and that's at 70+.  If you like to actually hear your television ...buy something else.  I hate it so much.  I'm going to try to return, but boxing it, etc I'd probably only break even.  You'd be better off taking 5 hundred dollar bills and lighting them on fire. I'll be hooking my 32 back up and never buying another TV again.  Also, I LOVE Samsung....I exclusively use their phones and washer dryer for years with no issues....this TV is just garbage",

    "Let me say that this tv is HUGE. It's over half the length of my room and looks beautiful. I had a 32 tv beforehand and man, it is such a huge upgrade. I ran Doom Eternal to see how the picture quality was and I was amazed by the contrast ratio and the details on the screen. As a side note, I don't like the design of the remote. I'm more used to traditionally large remotes. The bigger they are=the harder they are to lose. I'll probably find something to combat this issue. Overall, I'd give this an 9.8/10 and would definitely recommend this tv, especially at this price.",

    "I could not use it because it was damaged screen was broken",

    "Has a great picture, fits my wall space perfect, the delivery and unpacking was great, makes my 65” tv look small",

    "THIS PRODUCT DOESNT LIVED TO ITS HIPE, FOR IT HAS POOR PICTURE QUALITY AND CONSTRAST. WILL NOT RECOMMEND. I'M A SAMSUNG DEVOTED CONSUMER AND THIS PRODUCT DIDNT MEET MY EXPECTATION  CONSIDERING THE BRAND NAME.",

    "The 50 inch TU7000 in our bedroom has a great picture and sound. We needed a new tv for the living room so we thought we would buy the new version of this tv, the AU8000. However, in order to make the new version ultra thin, the picture seems to be compromised and the sound is annoyingly tinny. If you are considering this tv, we would recommend you buy the previous TU7000 series instead. A much better picture and the sound magnitudes better.",

    "excellent product and we have been using it since 6 months and hope it work for several yearshowever, the delivery man took away all the packing materials and wondering what to do when we need to move to another apartment/place",

    "Every time tv is turned on the picture contrast has to be adjusted. The dark shades are out of focus every time",

    "Picture and sound quality is clear.",

    "Bought this on sale for a family room. Picture is good. Sound is OK. A little tinny but it’ll do for now",

    "I love the Samsung tv and Amazon let me pay for it with monthly payments it made it easier thanks Amazon and Samsung",

    "Just got rid of my little crt TV finally and researched for something for the 21st century. This 55 picture is stunning. I'm very happy.First one arrived cracked. Delivery persons immediately returned it with no problems at all. Second one arrived one week later. They set it up and I sat and watched. :)",

    "This TV'S a great deal and deserves a really great ranking but I don't think I can do it.",

    "I bought this TV specifically for the touted Alexa built-in features and because my family has a Samsung that has, despite a couple of difficulties with an external soundbar, been reliable for several years.TLDR; In this TV Alexa is only accessible by using the mic button on the remote. Full stop. Don't bother buying it if you want a seamless and immediate hands free Alexa experience, or even think you can get clever and integrate an Echo device to serve as a constantly-listening hands free system.The furthest I was able to get was to enable Alexa to power cycle the device handsfree. But even then, it remained unable to open specific streaming apps, adjust the volume or other standard TV functions.Even to get to that minimal level of functionality required installing a bloated Smartthings app and creating a Samsung profile, Samsung's lame attempt at becoming the hub of your Smarthome (instead of plugging into the one I already have and they claim is built in). So even though I'm returning their crummy TV, Samsung will ultimately get the last laugh by having my email address and cell phone that they can now sell to the highest bidder.This, despite being an adept and frequent Alexa user, several attempted workarounds and contact with Samsung support.That Alexa is only accessible through the remote summarily defeats the purpose of its inclusion in the first place. I'm not looking to use Alexa to tell me the weather or a joke when I'm sitting on the couch. I'm looking for it to turn on the TV to a specific streaming app or mute or immediately pause when I have my hands full or am on a sudden call in the space where the TV is mounted.  And to do that, I need to have the remote in-hand. At that point, I might as well just use the remote; the reason I use Alexa in the first place is to avoid having to be reliant upon a remote control (I have lost one or two).(I suspect that this is by design on either Amazon or Samsung's part -- that one company or the other does not want a competitor to have full functionality to their platform. The problem with this strategy is that ultimately it is the customer who suffers the frustration of a non-functioning built-in feature)",

    "Compared to my au8200 55in this tv is horrible the sound is tinny the color appears washed out",

    "I got the tv after waiting a week, and the whole bottom part of the screen is cracked and the tv won’t do anything but come on. I’ve seen other reviews where it came broken so just buyer beware, I’m going to go to Walmart now and purchase the same tv for even a little cheaper.. very disappointed.",

    "Showed up undamaged.  Works great",

    "Purchased tv Dec 2021. Tv shipped/came quickly in a few days. Great picture, easy setup. After checking other reviews, I got this tv to hook to my older reciever to have surround hooked thru eARC adapter. Played great and sound was awesome until an update April/May 2022. After first call canceled medical reasons, repair came. Was told because of update, it will no longer work with my system and I needed to use with tv speakers or purchase a newer reciever/sound bar with hdmi. Amazon is not the problem here, it's Samsung. So if you fall in this category, then I say look elsewhere. Otherwise it looks to be a great tv just don't expect to hear it.",

    "I like new 4k tv crisper picture great for watching anazon paper girls and other movie app great price could been a little cheaper price my last samsung tv 40 in been having for 10yr time for me to upgrade to features",

    "the sound cuts out intermittently and there is no fix, i replaced it and same issue, i researched it and many others have same problem with no customer support from Samsung.fortunately amazon quickly accepted the the return, both times -  with no issues",

    "Tv Samsung 65Samsung es Samsung, todo Perfecto.",

    "Love my new TV! Mounted it in my bedroom, love that the off light is not bright when the TV is off. Remote is nice and sleek. TV comes with Samsung channels (free), and all the apps and smart features. Easy to use.Only thing I’d suggest is getting a sound bar for better sound, it can be a tad quiet (not bad enough to regret purchasing).",

    "For the price I can't imagine a nicer picture.  The TV was extremely easy to setup.  Other than the obvious stuff one would expect in a Smart TV (all of which it does very well), the unexpected things I like best are (1) it's easy to connect Bluetooth earbuds, (2) the included remote is able to control my Cox cable box/DVD & perform the basic functions, and (3) the remote uses RF so it works from a distance & you don't have to point it at the TV.",

    "We love our latest TV, perfect picture and vibrant colours.",

    "Tv looked opened and returned with frame cracked",

    "Great update for my old TV. Smart features a great ,tv works smooth. Connection stay connected. Not sure why other reviews say that tv get disconnected  all the time it think it is internet provider they use. Picture quality is great and my boys love use it to play video game on this tv. Better frame rate and high resolution.",

    "I bought this to upgrade my Samsung FPT5084 plasma and HT-X70 theater system that I bought in 2008. Never once had a problem with it but it just generated to much heat and not very smart! No comparison to picture quality, the plasma won hands down. The sound leaves a lot to be desired so I purchased a Samsung Q700A soundbar and I'm very pleased. Let's hope I can get another 14 years with this combination!",

    "I'm so tired of not being able to hook anything up in the living room. A ps5 out of the box won't even display on this TV. We had to hook it up to an older TV and update it for it to work. The reason we even got a ps5 is because this TV wouldn't work with our ps4, so Iwas wholeheartedly pissed when my brand new ps5 did the same exact thing out of the box. Our nintendo switch doesn't work no matter what I do. I constantly regret buying a Samsung tv. The hdmi support is absolute garbage. Hopefully this will save someone else the headache.",

    "Looking good",

    "Barely made six months and already not working properly, poor product by samsung.",

    "It’s got a lot of glitches!!! Freezes up and has to be restarted multiple times every week and it’s brand new",

    "We loved this TV and first.  We have had it about 7 months when a line appeared across the screen.  We contacted Samsung as it is still under warranty.  I WILL TELL YOU SAMSUNG CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!!  They have been giving us the run around for 2 weeks.  They don't have anyone in our area to fix it.  Instead they want to send a trucking company to pick up the defective tv BEFORE they will issue us a store credit to purchase a new one.  We will be without a TV for about 2 weeks.  I will probably never purchase another Samsung product!",

    "I purchased this TV 10 months ago and it's no longer working.  Thought I could trust the Samsung brand but completely disappointed.  Also seriously questioning my choice to buy through Amazon.  Thinking it'd be better had I purchased through a local company who'd honor returns of defective merchandise within 1 year of purchase.",

    "I love how thin this tv is for mounting on the wall. But, the trade off is the terrible sound quality. The speakers are “tinny” sounding. Be sure to buy a soundbar if you buy it.",

    "I got this to replace a 15 year old, heavy 37 1080i (yes, 1080i) flat screen TV in my office that cost of 4x as much as this Samsung. Amazing how much of difference in technology between then and now. The older TV was only 37 but the dimensions overall are the same as the Samsung. I struggled to unmount it from the wall because it was so heavy. The Samsung was so thin and light. For newbie to 4K TV's, this is one to seriously consider, especially at this price. I own the 55 Samsung Q80T and for all its bell and whistle's, my eyes don't see a difference. I'm not an expert when it comes to HDR or anything like that... Like I'm sure most of you are not experts either. But I do my research before I put down my money.  Rest assured you will not be disappointed.",

    "First, the picture is top notch. The menu system could use some work, but that's just software. Easy to mount, fit right on my existing wall mount. Took maybe 20 minutes to set up. All the OTA comes in really well... these digital tuners have made incredible progress the last 20 years!But the remote. Ah the remote. It's not only Samsung. Just about every manufacturer. Why oh why can't you put in 5 or 6 LEDS and make these things backlit? How about a number keypad? C'mon. This TV is in the bedroom, I'm not going to drop more for a universal when it's only 1 device that needs to be controlled.",

    "Love it. No issues, came in perfect condition",

    "Great picture and Great Price. Delivery was perfect.",

    "Glad I bought it. Price was right and quality was fantastic. Amazon Prime day price outstanding.",

    "Fit picture to screen size is disabled. Movies are shown panoramic with a black bar at the top and bottom giving you a 43in picture. Older shows have a black bar on either side. Other than that, picture & features/ settings are great.",

    "I hate that the pre-installed apps can not be deleted. The customer should be free to choose their selections and not be forced to keep apps they do not want. I have not added any apps yet 49% of user memory is full. Bought this at AAFES. Next TV will not be Samsung,",

    "The remote is simple to use . The picture is excellent .",

    "It’s great! this is my first smart TV and I love it!",

    "The remote does not control other inputs, cable box, fire stick, etc. However, the picture is really good. I highly recommend this TV.",

    "It's big and that's the nicest thing I can say about it. aside from that the picture quality isn't any different than the Samsung TV I bought 15 years ago. it does not connect to RCA cables from my DVD player. it has a confusing remote that doesn't really ergonomically function properly. And the biggest problem is that I cannot hear anything out of it. I have the volume on 99 and it's just barely audible. so if you're going to buy it you have to then buy a soundbar and a subwoofer and maybe some surround sound speakers as well. so if you buy this plan on spending another $400 to compensate for the lack of audio.",

    "I am very happy with this TV.  The picture quality is great for movies and video games. The sound quality isn't good but that's expected with these super thin TVs.",

    "I went to Best ----store and the SALESMAN was an idiot  ,we only have wal----NEAR US . I was so frustrated then I thought oF AMAZON. I THOUGHT SHIPPING A FLAT SCREEEEN ALL THAT WAY---DAMAGE---WELL I READ ALL I NEEDED TO KNOW ABOUT THERE TV--BOUGHT IT, IT ARRIVED 2 DAYS AGO AND WORKS FANTASTIC WITH NO DAMAGE AND IT WAS ALMOST HALF THE PRICE. I HOPE SOMEONE READS THIS. MY WIFE AND I ARE VERY HAPPY  PHIL  T",

    "Like the design",

    "Wasn't expecting great sound from this AU8000, but never imagined it would be as bad as it is.  Voices are muffled and staticky and somewhat tinny!  Tried all the different sound settings, equalizer etc multiple times with no success.  Have an inexpensive portable 10W bluetooth Oontz Angle 3 speaker so tried it. Wow the sound is many, many, time better than the tv speakers. Either the speakers in this unit are defective or the AU8000 just have very poor quality sound!!! Seriously considering returning! Not real enthralled with the remote either.  For volume control you have to push bar up or down and pressing mutes sound. Guess it takes quite a bit of getting used to as I end up muting on numerous occasions.  Given how many times I accessed settings to play with the sound, it would have been nice to have a settings button instead of hitting home and then arrowing over several time to the setting icon.",

    "Why waste time in a store comparing models in store when Amazon offers this gem shipped right to your door. This tv is wonderful offering a nice array of options with a very reasonable price point. A very clear, beautiful picture!",

    "This is great TV.  Very clear picture and decent audio.  We've had Samsung televisions for the last 10 years and they have been great!  The price is hard to beat also.",

    "My mother turned 95 and we supposedly were ordering an alexa compatible tv and sound bar. Although tv and sound bar were shown as a unit the sound bar was not! Amazon tv techs did not know anything! Worked for hours and several days. Finally samsung was called and said it was not compatible. Amazon or samsung were not willing to help fix problem. DO NOT BUY if you want alexa compatible.",

    "The colors arent as vibrant as we had expected, but it is a good TV and works for our space and daily use. We like the Alexa integration and smart TV features.",

    "Damaged, requiring a refund.",

    "The packaging looked in perfect condition but upon opening the box first thing I noticed was top left corner was damaged at the plastic I was able to mostly pop it back together and it doesn't seem to affect the quality of the image in anyway but still a little disappointing for the$1000 price tag. Super slow and crashes often",

    "Decided to upgrade my living room tv and got the 65”. I excited when it got deliver but it Came with the bottom left corner completely broken in pieces and the screen was busted all over.  I had gotten a great deal with having purchased it on prime days. Unfortunately the refund process took a while and I’m not able to repurchase the same tv since the price went back up. Very disappointed with the Samsung product quality",

    "The TV is very clear and the HD is almost too much because you see everything! You have to rewatch movies over once you get this TV because the experience is different. It was a great purchase and we're happy with it!",

    "Beautiful picture and, yes, it's a smart TV for first-timers.  Good buy!  Remote control is about half the size of an AT&T or universal remote, meaning less features than used to.  Also, manual should contain more instructions about the how-tos of its own remote with the TV.  Remote takes a little time in understanding all the features.  But using the AT&T cable remote most of the time for TV watching since it also controls the sound level.  Members of household able to switch between TV watching and other media after a little effort.  Excellent choice in TVs and also if you're into all the SMART stuff.",

    "The sound is terrible. The Home Screen is annoying even when using cable box and not Wi-Fi.",

    "Was worried about the picture quality but I am very happy with it. I honestly have no negative comments at all for the TV. The features, smart features, remote, picture quality, low weight and ease of set-up. All very good for the price. If I had to formulate a complaint, it's that eventually, I will need to buy a sound bar because the low weight and thinness of the TV frame will only allow low-power speakers. I wouldn't hesitate if you're looking for a good quality budget TV.",

    "My new 65 Samsung seems to be just fine.  My issue is with the delivery.  I received a note when I ordered it that someone would call 30 minutes in advance.  They didn't.  The note also said the delivery people would take away the packaging.  Obviously they didn't.  Im not sure if I misread the directions/instructions but I wound up driving my SUV to the gate, loading it in the back of the SUV and then driving it to house garage.  I live in the country.  To repeat, TV seems fine, I'm glad I bought it.  The delivery sucked.",

    "The LED lighting went out on the right half of the TV after 3 months. I'm hoping Amazon/Samsung make it right.",

    "1st time it was delivered the enterprise drivers broke my tv , I called customer service and the fix the situation quick and fast . The tv came 7/23 and an Amazon driver was much better and it great !",

    "We would love to say how much we love the features and quality, but we cannot even see a picture. It was delivered with a severely cracked screen. Now, although we can return it for a refund, we don't get the option for an exchange so that we could get the same sale price on what we originally purchased. Now we also have to wait for the return to be received (which, we get), but then 7 days for refund and then another few days for a replacement at a higher price. Somehow does not seem fair.",

    "Like the Samsung tv channels",

    "Tv is great. But remote doesn't work, making TV useless.",

    "So I bought this 8000 series to go into a media room right next to a 7000 series we use for movies. First problem the screws for the mount were all wrong. If anyone is curious it takes m8 1/2in screws. But get it mounted set up and the dang remotes for the 7&8000 TV's control each other at the same time. So anything we do on one tv is automatically done on the other. Samsung suggested using the smart things app or buying another companies universal so I'll try that and might update. Aside from all that the remote that came with it is horrible super tiny and flimsy no number buttons no source button total garbage. UPDATE So I bought a universal remote non Samsung brand and it still controls both TV's. I can use the echo dot and the Samsung smart things app to control it but that's a mega pain so I'm going to send it back and get a different brand. I will say though Samsung support wasn't very helpful but they tried so I give them credit for that.",

    "I don’t know why Samsung insists on making products its customers will hate. How is it that I spent so much money to own this tv and every time I turn it on I still have to see an ad, I mean you make tvs, how did you possibly miss ALL of your customers ditching cable and tv because of ads and think it was a good idea to make them an unavoidable part of the Samsung experience. As I started to research how to get rid of the ads, I ran into story after story of how these tvs are also built to basically brick themselves after a few years as well. Also, no way to get rid of the ads without blocking the Samsung ad domain on your router. These are bad tvs, Samsung is a bad company.",

    "Could use a slightly bigger remote as it is a little narrow slightly hard to see control buttons, feels like a kiddie remote",

    "Specifications state it has auto on and auto off, it however only has auto off.  I purchased this to be used as a workboard in a call center and we need them to turn on at a specified time and then turn off at a specified time.From the manual: On TimerYou can set On Timer to turn on the TV automatically at a specific time. On Timer is only available if the Clock has been set.This function may not be supported depending on the model or geographical area.",

    "Both tv and packaged arrived damaged. Very disappointing",

    "After going to the expense of  having a professional mounter-installer come out to unpack, mount, and install  --the TV was shipped damaged. Now I am out the expense of a failed install and the additional cost of installing yet another one to replace the defective one. And I have to figure out how to return something that took a truck to bring it my front door.",

    "Professional service and quality product",

    "Was a little apprehensive purchasing a 65” TV from Amazon. The shipping/delivery aspect, scared me to death! But Amazon is always excellent about customer service. The delivery was scheduled for 7/19 but arrived on 7/16. Good thing we were home!This is my second Large Samsung Tv and it exceeded expectations in every way. Set up using the remote was easy, and intuitive. It was harder finding the logins and passwords for the streaming channels!The large box was delivered carefully by UPS with absolutely no damage whatsoever.I bought it on Prine day, and love it! Highly recommended on both TV quality and delivery and purchase from Amazon.",

    "I measured wrong, thought it would be bigger, but i kept it",

    "I did not buy this though Amazon.com. bought from bestbuy but i thought I'd share my experience.This samsung AU8000 50inch UHD 4K smart tv is a great budget tv. The picture is crisp with good colors and a vibrant display, BUT some issues arose. Fitst, Weak internet connections results in streaming services crashing and forcing the device into random restarts witch is a pain. Second, sound quality is not there. If you use a soundbar than your ok and dolby atmos witch is supported but though eARC hdmi soundbar enabled devices. Therd. You might run into issues while  resetting the tv itself. Conclusion. Do you homework before purchasing",

    "Great TV",

    "The quality of features available on this TV is far better than any TV I have ever owned. The picture's colors are cleaner and sharper and make you almost feel like you are there. I am extremely pleased with this TV.",

    "So, the picture quality is awesome and the TV is awesome, but how is Samsung not making the settings such as sleep timer, or a button for settings in itself a button on the remote?  So in order to select a sleep timer, I have to do several clicks.  Even to get to settings, I have to do a couple of clicks.  Come on now Samsung, add another button to your empty remote.",

    "It’s easy to set up, fantastic picture and remote once you get used to it is the smartest remote I’ve ever had. Less buttons. Buttons you need not a bunch of crap you don’t need. Very satisfied and would purchase again and would recommend to anyone",

    "The tv is perfect. Setup was easy, I sat that only if you are tech savvy. The remote works well for all streaming services. You will need a more advanced all in one remote if you want to flip channels or do a direct number jump. Picture is what you would expect. I am happy with this tv and would recommend to family and friends.",

    "Wish I had a booklet to refer to",

    "I got the 65 inch TV to replace an old 1080p flat screen. The picture is amazing. The built in TV speaker sound is not that great. I ended up ordering a new sound bar to go with the TV.  Great deal for the price.",

    "This is fresh out of the box.. hooked everything up, turned it on & this is what happened. Doesn't look like a shipping issue as the box was fine.",

    "Can't go wrong with Samsung!!!!",

    "Good quality",

    "I ordered this television to use for more precise color as a video editor and also to game on. The television is great but the HDR functionality is pretty disappointing. I've calibrated the display settings on my PC, used the TV settings and even messed with in program settings but cannot get a good image that's not blown out or extremely dark. I've tried everything and am pretty sure that this television cannot support clean and accurate HDR. Also, while the resolution is set to 4K in all possible places I was still able to count the pixels and the image is clearly half what is advertised. I don't know if it's just mine or if it's a problem with the actual model. 477 dollars is cheap for this type of television.  I suppose you get what you pay for.",

    "Purchased for my parents to replace a samsung, works good, need to get used to the menus vs samsung, but over all he likes it",

    "Great TV for the money.  Very nice picture",

    "From what I've read; This was a good buy, other reviewers said that this TV was good overall and worth the money. I'm sure that I'd be saying the same, had it not come completely broken upon arrival.",

    "The only thing wrong with the TV is the remote is very small for people with big hands.  We love the TV",

    "the TV arrived defective. I spent countless hours on amazon support and they promised they will send someone to pick it up. So far they missed the pick up time and keep deferring it. meanwhile they have my money and im stuck with a non working TV a large oneI had to dispute the charge using my credit card company.DO NOT BUY BIG ITEMS FROM AMAZON. THEY HAVE TERRIBLE SERVICE WHEN YOU NEED LARGE STUFF RETURNED.",

    "Day one with my new tv. Love it , except the remote, the volume button only mutes . You cannot control volume, the Bluetooth option where you can use your phone as the remote is the only way to adjust volume, a real hassle as it has to “ connect to Wi-Fi “ each time. Also no sleep button. I like to fall asleep to my tv and have it turn off, even the universal remotes don’t have a sleep option. For a 2021 model I’m surprised how lousy of a remote control design . Picture is fantastic. It’s Like being in the same room with actors",

    "Excellent picture for the price of product",

    "Tv was slow and app integration was really poor.",

    "Let me begin with saying I've  always  been  happy with Samsung  products. I'm  writing this on a Samsung  tablet. I use one of their phones.. This TV was terrifically annoying  to set up. The included batteries  for the remote were dead. Registering a new Samsung  account was about impossible. The remote itself was a puzzle. Why the instructions do not cover basic operations  is another mystery. For 2 cents more that could be done. After  wasting  a lot of time I boxed it up.",

    "I got a defective one. The corner of the tv is white all the time, no matter what I watch or the settings I choose (see pictures). Now I gotta return it, Amazon said they'd get a crew to come pack it for me and ship it back. Turns out, I gotta pack it myself, because the crew won't do it. I'm 5'1 and can't do it, it's too big and heavy. Amazon is really trying to get me to keep a defective item, and all I've gotten is dismissive, rude reps who lie and are extremely rude. Amazon has fallen. I've had prime for 12 years and I think this is my last year.They will do anything to make you keep a defective product because it costs them money to get it back.",

    "Every time you turn on the TV you have to go through three steps to get to what you want to watch.",

    "Great picture with ok sound. I’ve ordered a sound bar for it. Overall, I’m extremely pleased with the purchase.",

    "The TV is beautiful.... just to save you some frustration though...the volume button is unique. Use your finger to push it up or down. If you push it IN, that will MUTE it.  Samsung really shoulda added a sticker to make us aware of this new maneuver... but once you realize how to work it, it's quite nice. Also, if you have a DVD player that uses the red, yellow, white cord...you will not be able to connect that. Those holes are obsolete I guess...so I'll have to upgrade my DVD player too.  But the picture is gorgeous and I'm happy with the price and quality.",

    "Gift for 91yr old who has vision issues.  Makes a difference,, but should get a soundbar with it too for best overall quality",

    "SAMSUNG 65-Inch Class Crystal 4K UHD AU8000 Series  Incredible picture, easy to use, visually stunning.",

    "Screen had a scratch on it and it's been a week and still no refund",

    "Upgraded our LF 55. This is better in every way.",

    "Got it for an Anniversary present.  Box came left on my sidewalk. Big hole in the box.  All styrofoam inside was creaked and broke.  Took a chance.  Turned it on. Half the screen is dead.  Better off buying it in a store.  Check it before you leave. This is a RETURN.",

    "Size is good for bedroom not for living room. I have raised return request and purchase 55 inch, but UPS not come for pick. Customer support needed.",

    "I received my new TV yesterday. First of all, Amazon delivered it quickly, before schedule. As far as unboxing and set up...all was super easy. The picture quality and smart features are wonderful. This is a great purchase!",

    "This TV is 10 pounds heavier than listed on the spec sheet.I bought this TV based on the weight and ultra thin design alone, since I am mounting it on a swing out cabinet door.Since it seemed extremely light, I checked several sources.... all say 8.9 lbsProbably meant 8.9 kg.... but that doesn't make it okI now have to reconsider whether I keep it or hassle with the return process.I love the ultra thin part... it's a great looking TV.",

    "Got this TV to replace our 65 inch 6 series Samsung TV. Love the new slim remote with easy access buttons to streaming. Also our old tv remote works on this tv too. Tv is also slimmer than our old one. I thought the picture quality would be significantly different but there is a slightly better difference. I love the Samsung brand TVs particularly bc you get free channels that you would get if you had cable for free forever! Samsung is the way to go!",

    "👌🏻",

    "This was easy to set up. Picture is really clear. Remote is quickly responsive. We are very pleased with this TV.",

    "first i want to start by saying that if you want to change the order of the apps , PRESS SELECT BUT KEEP PRESSING DOWN FOR ABOUT 2 TO 3 SECONDS , and you should see  MOVE / REMOVE .I have  this Television  in my bedroom , i dont spend much time watching tv there so my television  viewing is very brief . The only thing i could say i dont like about it  its the volume , when listening to a music radio app for example and i turn the volume up , its not that great  but everything else its good enough for me .",

    "I love the fact that I can use my television as a smart tv and also with my Cable provider with just one click. Life has been made easier for me with this television",

    "Wish we had bought something else.... setup is a night mare and Samsung is little help!Their tech support is so hard to understand and its repeat, repeat, repeat. The voice onthe TV yammers on and on about something, again, hard to understand talks at machine gunspeed and impossible to turn off.Not what I would expect from Samsung!",

    "Just received this tv and literally the remote control didn't work when I tried setting up the TV. I couldn't select remote control or phone to use the tv and knee the controller had an issue. Bad purchase",

    "Picture quality and sound is amazing. I was worried we might need a sound bar but the tv sound is plenty, and love the smart features",

    "Has worked really well for us for our budget. No issues. Great TV",

    "Lousy product. Sound disappears and comes back. Scheduled for my third service visit tomorrow. Worst cust. serv. ever. Kept transferring me to other depts. Over an hour on hold no results. Tried to register warranty. TV model doesn't show up. Samsung said it is Amazons fault and the serial number and model number don't match. NEVER AGAIN. Still trying to see what Amazon has to do with model numbers or serial numbers. Now the service visits are up to 5. 1st no fix 2nd put in new board and didn't work. 3rd cancelled by rep 4th rescheduled 5th too late set returned. Lousy lousy stinking cust serv and repair service.",

    "Agonized over buying a new TV.  One of the things that is really difficult to choose on Amazon.  I live in a 600 s/f studio apartment, and this 55 unit is just perfect.  Sits in front of a 9' wide window, and the picture is still easy to see.  I also use it as my desktop computer monitor, and that integration into the smart services was flawless.  Biggest q for me was does it support YouTubeTV and the answer is yes.  Honestly amazed that I got such a great TV for an affordable price.",

    "Was a little skeptical, but it actually came on time, the boxed well, the smart functions are great, and the picture quality is really good.  I would definitely recommend.",

    "I was nervous buying a TV online without seeing it in person but my son wanted one for Christmas (he told me just days before the holiday) and the local stores were sold out of the size/features he wanted when we went shopping. So I rolled the dice and ordered this online and to our pleasure - it is actually AWESOME! Super clear - plenty of usb/HDMI/comp inputs and awesome HD4k! A very nice TV for the price!",

    "Great tv with built in Alexa ! Great picture and built in apps are awesome.",

    "This 4K TV delivers a great picture and sound. I wasn't sure when ordering if it would deliver the quality as a QLED. But it proved me wrong, clarity is crisp.Frame rate is good at 60fps.",

    "Clear picture, fast processor, plenty of features makes this a great buy for the price.",

    "Completely dead out of the box.Unpacked the TV put it on its stand with the legs it comes with. Fairly easy to install. Plugged in nothing. Use the remote control nothing. Unplugged plugged it back in used the button on the bottom of the TV nothing. I’ll complete waste of time and now I have to store this monstrosity for 15 days until it can be scheduled to be picked up. Absolutely horrible. I have never bought a TV from Amazon that did not work perfectly right out of the box.",

    "I will use this set as a monitor for my new Windows 11 desktop in my bedroom, and as a second TV.",

    "This is a Mid/Low range TV, that could have been betterPros:Very slimPicture is ok for the priceCons:- TV stands in an angle when on the provided feet- To set up the TV need to provide almost all private details (name, birth date, address , email)- To complete setup you have to agree to let Samsung monitor everything you watch, this step cannot beskipped, if you don't agree it go back to the start of the setup process.- No Audio output to connect external speakers- No volume control for the Bluetooth sound output- Advertisements  on the Home screen that cannot be removed- Cannot connect Wifi speakers (Only  Samsung Wifi speakers)",

    "I've had this 85-in Samsung TV for less than a year and the onboard components that control the television brightness are already malfunctioning! I tried several times to adjust the picture and the problem keeps reoccurring. I'll be watching a movie and the picture will suddenly become so dark that I can hardly see anything. Extremely disappointed!UPDATE: I contacted Samsung and they did have a local repair shop come out and replace the screen on location. Of course I expected this because the unit is not even a year old. But the repair technician said that this kind of white shadowing was normal for that unit. So I'm still disappointed and kind of expect that this will happen again.",

    "Picture went out after about 8 months. Wasn't a very good picture from the beginning. Then, dead. Sad.",

    "Love it , huge view",

    "It’s a beautiful tv. Came in a 55” box.it’s 48”So that’s annoying. Not going to return it because that’s a pain but yeah not 100% happy but it’s fine",

    "The overall tv has a great picture and works well. If you do not want to watch all your movies in wide-screen,  don't buy this TV. It does not let you change to fit the screen in the settings",

    "No prblems with it seems to work real good from what i have seen.",

    "Return it .",

    "This is a lightweight, very thin flat screen TV, with a GREAT picture! Really.It's very thin and feels fragile. It has stiffener strips on each vertical edge to make it more transportable, and they come off easily.Our 55 faces a window, and on our older LG we always had glare. This is a more matte surface, and has very little reflection. They did a good job with this. We don't have to close the blind now, even on bright days.We use a ROKU, and this is not completely compatible with our ROKU remote, so we have to use the Samsung remote to turn the TV on and off, and to adjust sound. I'd prefer to need only one remote.We're still in our first month of use, so I may revise this. For now, I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, because except for the remote thing we like it. We are using our LG sound bar and woofer and they work well.The mounting screws for the wall mount are a different size from LG TVs, so a trip to Lowes to find the metric sized ones needed, and a bit of drilling in the mount to send the screws through was the major delay in getting it hung; it could have been worse.",

    "i had an accident in my apt...fell off ladder hanging a picture and fell into my tv a very good samsung 42 and it was pretty new(4 years old) and played great...oh well things happen...i'm a senior and i am grateful i did not break my neck...well i got on amazon to find a new tv...i decided on this one....what a great choice..this utlra hd 8000 series not that i know what that means, but it's awesome...best picture i ever saw..if you are looking for a new tv you won't go wrong with this one..i bought the 43 what a great price",

    "Came as advertised.  I bought this in April 2022.  So for so good!!  No complaints.",

    "This was a great buy! I did not realize the clarity and brilliance of television until I installed this at my parents house. Mom loves it and that is what counts. Easy to use and a ton of smart features.",

    "Samsung has one of the best quality pictures out there. Beautiful colors.",

    "great bedroom tv, all of the smart tv options built in",

    "Don't enable the Smart features or it'll abuse you with ads.  If you leave them off, it's a good 65 screen that will nag you to turn on the Smart features every time you use it.",

    "Excelente tv con sistema inteligente.Excelente tv, buena imagen y sonido con excelentes funciones. La recomiendo!!!",

    "We like the picture have continued issues with the sound matching the lips of the picture. We tried everything but it goes right back to mismatch again. For this reason we would unfortunately NOT recommend buying this television.",

    "Speaker quality an tone is not that good",

    "Do not buy this TV, the Sony X 85J is a way better TV for the same price. This TV only has 60 Hz frame rate. The X 85J has 120",

    "Overall a nice tv.  Speakers were lacking in sound. Bought a Samsung soundbar problem solved.",

    "Backlight bleed is visible in the upper corners of the screen when watching letter-boxed content in a dark room. I should have shelled out a few $$$ more for a better screen but I trusted Samsung and Amazon choice. If you Google this model number you'll see this is a common problem. This would be okay if you could zoom in but Samsung doesn't let you zoom when watching content from an app - I'd need to buy a Roku or Apple TV or something and connect via HDMI in order to zoom in.As for Tizen, I've already crashed it once and needed to do a total reset thus loosing all my settings. Now that I've cut back on multitasking by making sure to exit apps and stopped using the web browser it seems pretty stable but still I expected more from Samsung. I'm coming from a Roku TV, which doesn't allow multitasking, but hey that's better than letting the user overload and crash the system.  I should have bought a TCL with Roku oh well live and learn.",

    "Great",

    "I like everything about this 50 inch TV. I sent back the TLC tv that was junk.",

    "Perfect Picture quality.  It is also very affordable.",

    "Has a great picture, nice easy to use remote...worth the money if you can live with the annoyances.1. The set defaults up on a channel, with volume running. No no no. Sequence should be TV on, quiet, pick what I want, THEN volume.2. You can't get rid of their default smart service choices. When you add a service, you have to continually scroll through the entire list, to get to what you added. It's so annoying that I finally put my Roku box back on it, and leave it on, just to avoid the truly messy smart screens.",

    "The TV I ordered had a power cable that wouldn't secure into the jack. I believe we received a refurb or a bad build on this. The TV works though and I don't want to go through the hassle of getting it repackaged and returned. Overall I can't complain too much since it was a sub-$1000 TV.",

    "This tv is very sleek and has a nice screen with very good picture quality.But for me the user interface is extremely clumsy and annoying and was a pain to figure out how to disable some of the ads. It's not very user friendly and the remote is terrible.",

    "I use this as a computer monitor, and it is outstanding. I have it mounted on a standard desk, you are able to use 4 screens at the same time.",

    "This TV is a must have. It’s a far better by then anything else out there the quality of the picture is amazing. The color of the contrast really everything. It has a great smart features and looks great",

    "Love this tv. Love all the options it has.",

    "Initially I was very pleased with this purchase. Great picture, and I loved the streaming and apps. Then it was discovered that the HDMI ports did not work. The first to trips from Samsung service they replaced the main board and when they did, the TV stopped working all together so the put the original main board back in and ordered a third. Upon replacing the main board a third time with the same result as the first 2 attempts,They reinstalled the original board. but this time there is a bright white light along the bottom of the middle of the screen. The tech told me not to worry. Samsung would replace the TV. We it turns out that Samsung will not replace the TV because I purchased it through Amazon. The best they will do is refund my purchase for the TV. So now I am stuck with a broken TV that it is now my responsibility to get rid of, and a 4 year extended warranty that's worthless and who knows when I will even see the refund. Very Disappointed all the way around on this deal.",

    "I've had the TV a few weeks and like it. I don't like Samsumg remotes as they are not user friendly and batteries difficult to replace so hopefully Samsung will read ALL the complaints on their remotes with such a bad design and not user friendly.",

    "We are on our 3 85 inch tv in less than 2 years in the same location, 1st was the Hisence 85 inch, that the HDMI just q7it working, of course just out of warranty, o we ordered another Sumsang 85 inch of which we have 4 other that have been fine, when the deliver was made 1 guy with a lift gate arrived, however to save time he just slid it 1/2 way out of the truck, and then got down out of the truck and slid it out a little further and pivoted it on the truck edge, when we were installing it guess what center of the bottom of the tv screen was cracked, sent it back, then next 1 arrived with 2 men and a lift gate, almost the same situation, be careful, this is just laziness to save time, but at your expense, and I have paid 2 times to install it, now waiting on the 3 rd one, a little crazy huh?",

    "Still learning the remote, but overall great tv.",

    "Product arrived on time and in perfect condition! Simple and quick installation.  Beautiful picture!",

    "All smart tv’s are smart these days.  The question should be which has the best features and compatibility.  Samsung trying to super compact all controls.  Why???!!  I spend more time messing with this remote than watching my tv in peace.  So hard to navigate just one single app. I have to go through so many steps with my remote just to execute something.  By far Sony has the best remote control and I can link my phone in 1second, fast fwd, rewind, jump around the features of each app so easily.  Go with Sony!  Can’t believe I made this decision.Update 23June2022- Too much lag..app to app just too much lagging..too much back and forth to get the app from freezing and lagging..and I have the best internet service",

    "arrived as scheduled.  tv appears to be good.  remote a little hard to get adjusted.",

    "Bought this tv for my husband for Father’s Day. Once the tv was set up it didn’t even turn on.",

    "I love the picture quality and sound.  I don't need to constantly press the volume up button to enjoy a movie like I do on my TV by another company.",

    "The Samsung TV picture quality is excellent.  All of the apps were present and easy to manipulate.  I added a sound bar to create a clear surround sound.  The remote is small, but I am used to a Samsung remote.  Samsung is a good choice if you want to stream and not have cable or extra  equipment.",

    "VERY glitchy Tv. Nearly every time I use the tv it lags, and in many cases needs to be “rebooted” for volume to work. I called Samsung support and their feedback is that “software can be buggy”..",

    "Pros:4k. Thin profile. Very small bezel.Cons:- Smart TV software is terrible. Autoplays the samsung TV+ app on startup and there's no way to change this.- Picture presets are very bad. I will need to manually correct for a while to get the picture to not look like garbage- Speakers are terrible. Even for a TV this is pretty bad. People are muffled.- Brightness is lacking- The smoothing and autocorrections are terrible and you cannot turn them off. I want to watch the film that the filmmakers made, not a bunch of AI algorithms changing the picture quality to control blur and stuff. Just terrible.",

    "TV arrived damaged. It was almost as if the TV had been used before. About an third of the TV had light spots on it. And turning the brightness down only made it worse. I always get Samsung's but was disappointed with this one.",

    "I paid for a brand new TV and just opened the box and there's no remote control. No buttons on the TV and zero paperwork in the box that looks like it was opened and returned before I got it",

    "it looks great. 4k is really mesmerizing. Only downside is the smart features are not really smart at all.",

    "Sound and colour quality are problematic. Sounds brakes, pause for seconds and the your can hear the next word. Therefore, previous word is missed. Colour fluctuates between screen meaning fades. I have another Samsung tv which has no issues. That is why bought this one. However, the sound and colour quality is no match with Samsung standard. Probably, this unit released to the maker by error.",

    "The tv is nice and thin, but the picture sometimes is a little jumpy. If you don’t watch straight on the color seems to be redder.",

    "my television came broken This is not good not happy 😡😡😡😡and i still waiting UPS pick it up",

    "Failed within first week of use. Still awaiting repair after almost a month. Would not recommend.",

    "Terrible downgrade from the 2020 model. Image quality and speakers are terrible. Don't bother connecting a HDMI to it because it flickers regardless of what you do to try to fix it. I returned mine because it's all around a waste of money and just awful.",

    "Excellent TV",

    "Has a great picture!! Great purchase!",

    "Great product!!!",

    "Crystal clear great quality tv for a good price.",

    "Biggest problem is the picture. Horrible artifacting / halo effect / light bleed. On what’s supposed to be a dark or black background, massive cloudy white spots emerge.Smart features are just plain bad. No real Home Screen and it’s super obnoxious that you get served ads on the Home Screen on a tv you’ve paid for!Remote control was OK",

    "I’m a little late to the smart tv party but nonetheless this thing is a game changer. Super easy set up and it tied into my wifi and basically  did everything itself.  Crystal clear visuals. Had to add passwords/log ins for HBO and other platforms only once. Took some time.I added an upper end Samsung soundbar which eliminated the need for my entire surround system including subwoofer. I hardwired that in and it sounds much louder/more dynamic than the wifi option.The remote takes some learning but once that’s done, it’s very efficient. Alexa voice works great and I use it frequently. Ability to jump from platforms including Sirius XM is seemless.Overall a great rig for relatively low cost.I doubt the tv speakers alone are going to do it for you but apparently most built-in tv speakers suck nowadays anyway.  Add a bar or your existing sound system. You’ll dig it.",

    "Purhased it based on Amazon’s research onand recommendation of that particular model number.",

    "The quality of the picture on this tv is outstanding!! It's crystal clear!! I'm so glad I bought this! Getting used to the remote has been a challenge but we're adjusting.",

    "Remote is awful. Minimal buttons. Volume button only goes to mute, hold goes to voice control??🤔",

    "Do not buy this TV. I thought it was fine, threw away the packaging, and then a few days later was using it in a dark room and realized that the backlight bleeds through so badly that the edges are practically lit. This should be a defect but apparently Samsung considers it normal. In a dark room, watching anything with a dark scene or letterboxing will look terrible and you will not be happy. Get something else. I wish I could return.",

    "This is a good TV. Last 2 I bought conked out after 3-4 months. Only issue I have is the remote, which is a little difficult to see unless I’m a well lit room. Also, the apps are limited that you can put on the TV. Good buy though!",

    "There was a tin-can sound from the speakers that gave headaches all around. Perhaps it would be better to forgo the ultra thin design and add some bulky speakers for a better sound experience. I didn't know it was a necessity to add other speakers or soundbar to actually use the TV. Had to return.",

    "Delivery to your house. Tv was delivered with no scratches or dings",

    "The picture's good, the smart features not so much. Preloaded with garbage that you can't delete, underpowered processor, insufficient memory. I had planned to use the Fire Stick but it doesn't fit well and it complains that the USB port on the back doesn't have enough power. The sound of the Fire Stick through the TV is bad and Amazon customer service could not fix that. The picture, sound and source settings routines are poorly laid out and most options are greyed out / not available. But the main feature, the Ultra Slim design, is nice and looks great on my bedroom wall. It's $150 more for the very similar Q60 model which has proper smart TV hardware, a noticeably better screen and anti reflective coating.After owning it for a few months, the audio is awful. Seriously, completely inadequate. Needs a external speaker. Firestick needs an external power supply, which negates the benefit of the thin display.",

    "Great product. Easy shipping. Great price",

    "Can’t count the number of times I’ve powered this tv on and it gets stuck on whatever channel it wants. Remote buttons do nothing. I power cycle the tv a few times and finally get what I want. Also, the remote battery life is about 2 months. This tv has frustrated me so many times I will not buy another Samsung tv. I’ve owned tv’s most of my life but this tv is awful.",

    "Worked fine after I took it out.  3 days later, I did a software update and now the WIFI won't connect.  Nothing has changed on my router or WIFI.  The only thing that happened was me updating the TV's software.  I tried a reset on all settings to factory default and still can't fix.",

    "This definitely was not “new in the box”.  It had been returned because some of the bolts were missing and also there were scratches on the back of it.  All in all though, I’m pleased with the purchase.  I haven’t mastered the remote control and am not a huge fan of it (there was a tutorial on how to use it.I soooo prefer things to be simple and straight forward).  The picture quality is so good!  Sound is just okay.  I’d recommend adding a speaker to it.",

    "Great picture and smart features , but a terrible remote , glad my old Samsung BM59 works with this TV",

    "The picture is awesome.  I am upset about the remote control.  It doesn't appear to have a fast forward function.  Wish I had known this beforehand.  Is it possible to have a different remote with FF work on this TV?",

    "You can see large pores and wrinkles in close ups here",

    "Just purchased in June 2022. Delivered in perfect condition to my doorstep. Lightweight. Super thin. It DEFINITELY pairs with your Dish or Direct TV system. (Yes, I am still a satellite TV customer.)  You can even pair your DISH remote control with the TV BEFORE it even arrives! I watched a YouTube video that showed how to do it. You can simply press Home on your Dish remote (do this on your OLD TV). Then tab to Menu > Remote Control > change TV brand to Samsung > Next > Scroll thru all the hundreds of Samsung models until you find UN43AU8000FXZA for model # > select it> you're Done! Now your DISH remote no longer works with old TV and works immediately with your new Samsung straight outta the box. NOTE: if you don't find UN43AU8000FXZA in your scroll list of models to chose from then select UN43TU7000FXZA. That is the prior model # of this TV before 2021. That's what I had to select for mine and it works. Also, I got a $30 full-motion mounting kit at Walmart that fits 40-55 inch TVs.  Perfect!",

    "I tried every assistant available and none of them display content that is being searched. Alexa says this is what I found and then nothing. Google assistant just errors out. Bixby doesn't work either. So this is why the TV received three stars. The picture quality is awesome though.",

    "I like this TV a lot, the quality of the image is amazing, it is thin enough to fit a tight space and so far I don`t have any problems with it. I only gave it 4 stars because the remote control kinda sucks, but I solved it easy by buying an universal remote and now my tv is perfect.",

    "For the last 5 years I have had a Samsung curved screen TV.  I needed to upgrade to 4K.  I had forgotten that 5 years ago I swore to never buy another Samsung TV.  Some of the worst documentation I've seen for any product.  They pack in so many features that a manual has to be huge but a simple well written start up guide should be included to get basic functionality.  They rely on built in on-screen start up but when it fails you're screwed.  To be fair, tech support is decent but wouldn't be necessary if they hired competent tech writers.  The picture is very good but the devil will be eating snocones before I buy another Samsung TV.",

    "Sometimes you just don’t know what to believe, after reading tons of reviews, I started having doubts about picture quality and brightness. I shouldn’t have worried, it’s awesome! The picture is so sharp and clear, with zero issues about brightness. It’s like we are seeing our favorite shows for the first time. Even dark night scenes that I used to always struggle with seeing are amazingly clear. The sound from such a thin screen has also really impressed me. I don’t know how they did it. I bought a sound bar at the same time I bought  the television but it’s barely an improvement, maybe just a bit deeper sound , but I could’ve saved my money and done without it. Maybe a sound bar would help movies.  Anyways it’s a great TV and I highly recommend it!",

    "There is no physical power button. The TV is advertised as smart but it is anything but smart.My remote didn't work consistently. When trying to set up the smart things app the TV is supposed to generate a QR code. My TV did not generate a QR code nor did the app locate the TV. Neither the app nor TV are smart.Samsung support is about as useful as a nail through the foot. They have absolutely zero options if the remote doesn't work. Zero. Options. Like I have stated, this TV is NOT smart.DO NOT BUY THIS TV.",

    "The picture so clear as if the people on the TV are sitting in your living roomAmazing TV.",

    "I bought this on June 24,2021, to replace a Samsung tv I was able to fix before this one arrived but I figured I would keep it as a future back up. Today I unpacked it from its undamaged box and hooked it up. The screen showed colored lines and what appeared to be two bullet hole style images. I am assuming the set is defective. Of course, it is well beyond 30 day return window.",

    "The TV is extremely excellent. I question if it was a return , even though I paid for brand new.Plastic wrapping , placement wasn’t consistent with a new tv",

    "Great picture.",

    "If you just stop playing a show/channel or music it defaults to bs Samsung channels non-stop. It's very annoying and you cannot change this default setting.",

    "I don't like the remote. It's different from all the others.",

    "Did not come with a manual to set up does not have hook up for my surround sound little remote difficult to maneuver must use cable remote to change channels and whatnot",

    "I watched a lot of unboxing reviews in Youtube and all of them have 2 remote controls (Simple and Smart ones). But, I got only one remote control (Smart only), which it doesn't have any numeric buttons on it so it's hassle to switch channels by numbers. Nevertheless, I was satisfied with the quality of the TV. If I get a simple remote, it would be great!",

    "First, the picture on this 75” TV looks great. Also, the sound is quite adequate at least for us senior citizens. I would rate the TV performance a 4.  The service at Samsung however is ridiculous.I called Samsung customer service on May 10 when the TV stopped working. After losing the connection with no call back, I called again and ended up spending a total of 130 minutes on the phone with them. We finally concluded that the remote controller was not working. The service rep said he would send me a replacement but that it could take up to two weeks. I told him that was unacceptable because I had a fairly new TV from them that I could not use. He said he would see what he could do to speed up delivery.I called Samsung customer service again on May 13. This time the rep said it was on priority order but he could not give me a tracking number. He claimed that he was a Samsung employee and not a third-party service provider but that he had no way to get into the system to see when it had shipped and when it was due to arrive. I asked if it was coming from South Korea and he said no it was shipping from New Jersey via UPS. I live on the East Coast so they could drive it to me in one day. I asked to speak to his supervisor, and that person also said he had no way to find out the status of the replacement remote controller. I asked him to send me an email when it shipped.After having no contact and no remote control device showing up, I called Samsung customer service again on May 18. Once again, the rep told me he had no idea when it would get here. He said the shipping activity was in a different department. I asked him for the phone number of that department, and he said he wasn’t allowed to give that. I asked him to call to get the status, and then he said Samsung shipping does not accept inquiries. He refused to let me speak to his supervisor.As I write this review, it has been more than three weeks since I first contacted Samsung customer service telling them I could not use my TV from them and they said they would send me a replacement remote controller. It has not arrived and I would not be surprised if it never did. I of course have not received a status email from them either. For a company with a great reputation for designing and manufacturing excellent devices, it boggles the mind that it would have such inept customer service. As a side note, the automatic turnoff feature, which we have programmed to go off at the same time every night, works for a few days and then stops working. Customer service of course has no clue how to fix that problem. That is why I would rate the TV itself a 4 instead of 5.Fortunately, Amazon has excellent customer service. After getting off my third call with Samsung customer service for this problem on May 18 and assuming they would probably never get me the replacement remote controller, I called Amazon where I had purchased the Samsung TV. The service rep told me they did not carry the remote for my TV as a separate item. However, he searched around and found me a generic Samsung remote controller. As usual with Amazon, the new controller arrived within two days, and TV has been working fine since then (with the exception of the automatic turnoff). Thank you Amazon!June 24, 2022 update. The remote from Samsung just arrived today – 6.5 weeks after we determined it was not working and they said they would send a replacement. If not for Amazon compensating for absurd Samsung customer service, we would have been without our new TV, which is under warrantee, for about 7 weeks.",

    "Great Room TV in well lit space.  Works well and smart hub processor is super fast.",

    "Poor picture quality and messes up Alexa machine",

    "Don’t like the screen picture",

    "Picked this up for my father as a replacement for his 14 year old Sony.  Pops is very happy with it.  Beautiful picture .  Easy to use!Samsung TV channels are a great addition!!  A free perk for sure.Fast delivery too!! Thank you!!",

    "EstafaEste televisor salió Dañado no sirve para nadaSe apaga cada 5 minutosDe verdad es una estafa",

    "Oh for the money this tv is amazing. The picture is eye catching and clear. I am impressed and plan to purchase more.",

    "HUGE....HUGE...this is a big dam tv, picture is great easy to setup amd really simple nice remote. Only negative is the interface/navigation is a bit laggy which is disappointing considering its a modern-day smart tv. Don't have this lagging problem with my older 65 inch Samsung smart tv. Over all its a great tv though.",

    "Great tv for a good price!",

    "better buy a sound bar. Not good tv speakers. A larger remote would be helpful, too small. Buttons have dual functions and gets  confusing. Screen blackouts occasionally.  It does have a nice picture.",

    "Bought it for my parents, they like it since it's very thin and the remote makes less noise compare to their previous one. It also has a lot of features like live TV and multiple apps preinstalled. Graphic quality is good as well. The only con is it's not android which I found out after purchasing but my parents don't need it so we are okay.",

    "The TV is very good overall. However, the actual tv feels very cheap and appears to be slightly warped on the top",

    "The picture quality wasn't that great. Not at all what I expected from a Samsung. The skin tones would change to all different tones. My older Samsung had great picture quality.",

    "Speakers are bad you need a sound bar",

    "ExcelenteTodo ok",

    "This TV is trash.  Picture quality is terrible.  Imagine cheap motel TV from 5 years ago.  How did Samsung sink so low ?",

    "Worked for 11 days and quit..",

    "Love the picture quality.The apps are convenient.Satisfied with my purchase.",

    "Ugh... I *wish* this TV was everything the reviews say... The picture quality is ok, but not mind-blowing. I have to adjust the brightness when it's day and night because it's so hard to see when there's light in the room. The very most annoying part of this TV is the crazy LAG. The voice control on the TV is awful. Sometimes it works, sometimes it just goes back to the home screen. Just going from one app to the next it's a several second delay. Like, I have time to check text messages in-between hitting the button to go to an app and it popping up. There is nothing about this TV that feels smooth. For the price it still is, I would definitely recommend going a different route- even if it means paying a couple hundred more.",

    "Me encantaYo tengo la del 2020 y se nota las actualización y cambios que hicieron en esta nueva versión. Me encanta!",

    "I purchased the 2020 model (UN55TU8000FXZA, 2020 Model) and a vertical line of dead pixels showed up a couple days ago, less than 2 years after I received it.  This is my third Samsung TV and the first one lasted almost 10 years.  Read the Most Recent reviews from the link below and you'd see that almost all the reviews from these two months were complaints on this TV becoming defective or completely inoperable in less than two years.  I understand the concept of return period and warranty, but no reasonable person would expect a brand new TV to last less than two years.  This review is a warning to those considering this product - do your research before making a purchase.  This brand is not what it used to be.https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Crystal-TU-8000-Built/dp/B084JH43DJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8",

    "Don’t think it’s normal or if this vendor has less quality tech",

    "Pros: tv is garbage. It is such a hassle to operate. It has the worst interface so far. The remote is horrible. The picture is awful. The audio is weak and tinny. Yeah, these are the pros.Cons: To use any of the extras on this tv you have to accept the terms and conditions, but it won't let you.It says that the server is under maintenance. It has said this for a year.Unable to get help from Samsung support.Absolute waste of time and money.After buying about 15 Samsung products, I will never buy from them again.",

    "This smart tv is dumb as a rock. Nothing but aggravation. Buy a fire or android tv instead unless you like watching ridiculous content every time you turn on . Using aps on this device is a horrible experience.",

    "This initial TV arrived with holes in it.  We sent it back and received a new TV that has worked fine.  However, Amazon charged our credit card a second time, and to date, hasn't refunded the second charge.",

    "This tv is worth every penny and more. Quick remote response, quick loading, beautiful picture quality, easy account setup. Unmatched compared to other smart tvs in value for price",

    "Everything i expected and then some price was beautiful TV is wonderful shipping was fast and delivery was very careful and even covered my products out of sight couldnt be more happy with purchase and i got 2 of them with insurance... 5 stars all day",

    "In the last week or so, I've noticed that all the apps just freeze.  Netflix, YouTube TV, HBO Max.  I have to hard reset it by unplugging and replugging for it to work.  I did it last night.  Its happening again this afternoon.  Not sure what could be the cause.",

    "This TV is k. It’s nicer than what we had so I guess I’ll hold on to it, but the picture is super dark and hard to see a lot of the time. Ive gone through all the setting and I’ve got the brightness turned up as much as it can go and it’s definitely not enough. That’s super disappointing, but otherwise it’s nice enough, especially for the price. The remote is fine and I love that I can get to Netflix and Prime easily but would like a button for other services too, like at least Hulu, but you can get to them from the Home Screen. Anyway, if it was brighter I’d be happy. Will probably replace in a year or two.",

    "If you are only connected via WiFi, it will give you a notice every time you start up that there is no LAN connection. Bitch, I know that, I have you set to WiFi. Every time. Then it sometimes follows up with would you like to set up a LAN connection? Bitch, for the thousandth time, no. Also, I miss my old Samsung because it had more sound options. All you get with this model is optical. Don't fix what isn't broken! I had surround speakers set up and now I had to buy a converter (defective), so now I'm wondering if the optical out even works on this POS tv. The remote is super minimal and the user navigation is pretty clunky. Also a laggy/slow response. 4/10 would not recommend.",

    "Samsung is usually so much better than this. I have many many Samsung products, including TV's and PCs. The speakers for this model are the poorest quality, all highs and no base. Even if you adjust the equalizer in standard mode, the sound is not Samsung usual standards, they really dropped the ball, bringing down the rest of the features. You'll need outside speakers or pick a different brand.",

    "I have three other Samsung tv's and they are great. Hate this specific model. Owned less than a year. Volume goes from 20-35 will little increase. Have to turn tv on/off three or four times to get volume. I would return if I could.",

    "My birthday present, love it, will enjoy time and time again",

    "the remote control does not work",

    "Had to call Samsung to set up.  The rep was wonderful and helpful.",

    "Can’t adjust backlight like you could on older models.  Some shows/movies are just too dark.  I returned.  I love my two other Samsungs.",

    "UPDATE: TV stopped working after 11 months. No reason it should have died like that. Be aware, this product will require additional extended warranties. I reached out to Samsung for warranty assistance, it took 5 different calls, kept getting disconnected from their overseas warranty support center. After 3 hours of phone calls, I was told to expect a phone call from product specialist within 24 hours. It's been 24 hours, no phone call yet.Old Review:I got the slim profile Samsung mount. Looks great. Make sure you give yourself a lot of extra time to install the mount. There are a lot of instructions.",

    "Great Tv. I got the 50inch which is perfect for my room. It’s bright, has a great sound system and you can definitely see the 4k. It’s definitely  good quality.",

    "Great picture great sound, easy to use. But the remote can be finicky, but force fixed it.",

    "It has standard Samsung TV quality but the speakers sound like tin cans. Purchase a sound bar if you are a regular watcher.Box had been opened before arrival and thin sheet protecting screen was no longer there.Overall it is a relatively good value",

    "Very nice in image is good the sound sucks.",

    "Perfect picture quality, terrific sound and everything is as clear and vivid as you would ever want. HDMI controlled through my other devices and seamless compatibility with my wireless devices. If I had an preferential dislikes, it's that I haven't disabled the actual TV function yet.",

    "After about 11 months my tv now has dead pixels green dots on screen",

    "Great TV great picture, however not as bright (max 300 peak nits). Upscaling is excellent old DVDs look great. Best for dark rooms. Unfortunately mine came with some dead pixels but Amazon did a great job in refunding me and set up the return of the TV.",

    "I purchased this TV to replace a Roku TV that was not working properly.  Roku customer technical service made TV worse.  Ill never purchase anything but quality electronics in the future.  I have multiple Samsung electronics and two TVs.  I will continue buying Samsung in the future.  Do not have any issues.",

    "It was left at wrong door and unannounced someone was supposed to be there help 89 year old lady lift the tv and batteries in remote were dead and very hard to hook up and program was supposed to be 2 people come in and set it up saw nobody was a sad purchase for a 89 year old lady",

    "Remote is unusually difficult to use. I have loved all Samsung products I’ve purchased in the past but this particular product has been very disappointing.",

    "We love the colors are so beautiful. Blacks are nice and crisp. We get sad when it's bed time and we have to watch on our old tv",

    "Received TV in great shape and fast, being a 65 inch, it was nice having it delivered free to front door. Set up in about 15 minutes and everything works great. The remote isn’t the best, they keep trying to make everything smaller and it’s really hard to see things on it especially at night, no light up dial.",

    "The picture quality is the best I've seen. The remote is OK but I'm using my older remote, it's user friendly",

    "This tv is awesome",

    "TV is awesome!!",

    "I’ve had this tv for a few months now and I dislike it more and more. Absolutely nothing is intuitive when it comes to setting the tv up. I wanted just the basic apps and an internet browser. The Home Screen forces you to watch adverts. No way around it with this model. The remote is difficult to use as the cursor speed varies and makes it unpredictable. The browser does not remember IDs and PW. There is something called a Samsung Pass that allows you to use biometrics on your phone to quickly access websites (it apparently stored login data), but how you set it up is beyond me. Over two hours googling and reading over Samsung websites and I gave up. Maybe it only works with Galaxy phones. I can’t find the answer. If you are only going to use basic apps and nothing else, this tv is ok, otherwise I would keep looking. I will complement the picture quality for the price, but I would still look elsewhere.",

    "I don't know what is worse the picture or the trash smart features. The remote is far from intuitive. It looks they let a 14 year old design the remote and did zero testing. The buttons are not intuitive, home is menu or something. The home brings up some awful clunky interface that tries to load previews for stuff no one cares about. This is the smart hub, I guess but it seems pretty dumb to me. The menu doesn't seem to be editable. The HDMI Arc is occupying an hdmi input port. The optical out is trash and super noisey. The picture is very stuttery. Sure the freeze frames are clear but the snapping around is awful. If I were the engineer that worked on this I would quit my job. The advanced option to disable video enhancement helps but the whole point to Samsung's fancy chip is to make the vodeo clearer. I'm not even one of the 144hz fan boys. I just know bad video feeds. I will never buy another samsung product.Save your money and get a higher end LG or  Vizio.Pros:- The colors are dope.- The 4k has all the 4k.Cons:- The 4k video processor is trash and makes it look like a freaking etchasketch, including the shake to clear.- Samsung smart hub.- Control your tv with your voice bro... Seriously?- The remote is designed by some kid named Cole and he hasn't graduated high school yet.",

    "The entertainment is extraordinary",

    "The delivery from the Amazon Professional Delivery Service was excellent. They even offered to take the Box with them, I always like to be asked or given the option. The picture quality is very good at 60Hz refresh rate. Some of the specs you may not notice or see about the TV.Wi-Fi 5 means 802.11ac technologyBluetooth: BT4.2Adaptive Sound featureAuto Power Off4K60Hz Refresh Rate.Has Digital Audio Out2 USB3 HDMI1 Ethernet (LAN)As with most TV's this thin, TV speakers can only do so much. Sound quality is a little Tinny. I have mine connected using Optical Audio to my Denon Receiver. With its Bluetooth capability, a Sound Bar will be an excellent add on for you.Can't find versions of the USB, HDMI, Ethernet (LAN) CAT versions, even on Samsung Website. Maybe at a Tech Support Site you can find out. So, I'm guessing it will be 2020 available types. TV manufactured in 2021.Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. As with any electronics or anything you purchase and have shipped, you will always have the risk of damage. So never hold that against a Manufacturer. Never had an issue with returns thru Amazon.",

    "Easy setip",

    "Picture is decent. The sound is very poor and doesn't allow for any adjustments unless you add a sound bar. Very poor compared to our other Samsung TV's.",

    "I bought the 75 size of Samsung's Crystal UHD & have loved it so much that I also got the 65 for my bedroom. What a fantastic crystal clear picture in every way. The colors are so vibrant & brightness is just perfect. I set my TV's on Cinema mode & I believe it provides the highest quality images. The sound is outstanding so a soundbar is not really needed. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the remote control. I changed both of them with $10 replacement remote controls I found on Amazon which are SO much better.I am an avid TV watcher & have tried many different TV's available on the market over the years. I can honestly say that I am now a Samsung customer for life! I am certain you will be completely satisfied with this TV. 😃",

    "Tv is great but it lags alot and its slow takes forever to keep up",

    "I have been talkin about getting a bigger TV for like 2 years and I finally pulled the trigger for Super Bowl this year. This thing is great. Great picture quality. Looks awesome even though my livingroom isn't huge.  Sound is ok, but I go through my system.Some of the smart features are a little annoying so I use Apple TV.",

    "I love Samsung but this TV right here the 85c au8000 is the worst and stupidest I've ever had! does not connect to anything it's a Fire TV from Amazon that doesn't connect to Alexa I talk to Alexa customer support Samsung customer support nobody gets it going and the remote is the most nonsense stupid thing I've ever seen",

    "Love the TV. Great picture. I would purchase another one.  Sound quality was good, but I purchased a Samsung Sound bar.  Connected easily. Great sound now.",

    "After binge watching on the tv for 2 days I am very pleased with my purchase. The 65” in tv came in a large box so I suggest getting another person to help you. Although I was able to carry the box to the 2nd floor with minimal issues. Sound and picture quality are excellent. Setup was very easy. For a sub $700 tv, this one is worth the purchase. The UI is fast and apps have not given me any issues.",

    "Has a good picture easy to use but the sounds now as good as I like.",

    "I no longer have to squint to watch TV. LOVE Samsung stream TV too",

    "Seamless transition to previous apps, Netflix and Prime.  Went from 51 inch Samsung to this, not state of the art but perfect for me.",

    "This had to have been put in the box this way. Broken on bottom edge.Very  poor",

    "This TV has a great picture, I didn't have to adjust any contrast and/or color.  Perfect right out of the box.  We have it connected to an antenna.  It has a guide so that we can see all the channels, info about the show that is actually large enough print to see across the room.  I would not hesitate to buy this TV again for another room.",

    "great seller Highly recommended",

    "I wanted to love it, but it continues to let me down. Unfortunately I bought two of them and I’m past the point of returns. Really aggravating when most apps freeze and the tv is unusable for hours. Will not buy another Samsung product.",

    "Purchased in March 22 2022. I had to do a lot of adjusting to get picture right but now it has a great picture it looks almost 3D. The packaging was great no tears or dents in box and was delivered on time. The sound of the unit is really good I hooked up a sound bar and could hardly tell the difference.",

    "Great quality",

    "Smart features",

    "The picture and clarity are fantastic. Very clear. The TV is used for watching g movies and shows; relaxation.",

    "Bought 2 TV, but one came in with scratched screen. Don have time to return.",

    "Picture is great sound is terrible - do you homework before you buy!",

    "The remote is junk. I have to push a button 100 times for it to work once. I purchased a universal remote and have the same problem. It’s the tv, it’s unusable. Good luck doing anything if you buy this piece of junk.",

    "Terrible. Garbage. Horrible. Not safe for children or families. Worse in every metric from competition. Mediocre to decent technology utterly ruined by rampant advertising and unignorable, non-optional, apps. Now I will argue these points.I specifically didn't connect mine to broadcast because I own the only devices that I want to display content from. However when the TV finished setting up the first words my daughter's heard were then his head blew up all over the place, like what a mess everything was ruined. Autoplay is intolerable but it's not an option, it's wholly unacceptable when the autoplayed content is harmful to children.There are large sponsored ads on the home screen that cannot be avoided unless you want to start doing your own networking. These included ads for hyper violent movies like 300, which while awesome, are not fit for children and I am not pleased to have had to explain to my daughter. The preloaded apps consume more than half of the space I paid for. They cannot easily be removed. They cannot easily be removed even if you get into developer mode. If you wanted TV this isn't it. It feels cheaply made, it's class doesn't fit well, it's less power efficient than LED TVs, and it deals with glare horribly.I bought Samsung because I wanted a higher quality experience than I received with TCL a cheapo. Instead I received a far worse experience with much more aggressive advertising and farther if you are options to avoid an overwhelming and unnecessary ecosystem. Not watching anything on this TV is a better experience than turning it on.Not only would I not recommend this TV. I actively recommend against it and anything else produced by the team of folks who made this. What a hot pile of garbage that disgusts me to my core.",

    "pleased with my purchase",

    "I like the tv. I went from a Sony Bravia to this Samsung. I made a great choice. The puvure",

    "Good",

    "The simplified remote took a little getting used to, but we love the TV. Easy set-up.",

    "Buena  imagen 4k. Horrible  control remoto.Televisión 4k con buena imagen. Los canales  locales con buena  transmisión. Lo malo: el sonido  es deficiente. Resuelto  con una barra de sonido. El control  remoto es una basura.",

    "The picture on the TV is quite nice to look at compared to my 15 year old 42 inch Philips flatscreen. But the sound that comes out of it is god awful. It’s like they were intentionally making it bad so you have to buy a sound system for it. Lol but all in all I like it!",

    "You can never go wrong In purchasing a Samsung Tv. And all the apps. WOW",

    "Took a long time to set up due to inability to use cheap remote provided.  If you are of the older generation, you will definately need help from someone who is much younger and new generation tech savvy.  Remote is not user friendly and instructions provided do not help much.  Had to request family help to set up TV features.  Have figured out how to use old remote...new one is useless.",

    "Picture quality is amazing. It is a smart tv. Samsung TV has smart sync with my Samsung phone and it is super simple to cast stuff to it. Remote is small and sleek, buttons are responsive and feel like good quality. Comes with Samsung TV which is a free TV platform. Some apps i couldnt find for Samsung, but that doesnt degrade the quality of the TV. The size is perfect i got the 55in, and its not too heavy. I was able to mount it to my wall myself and im not a big dude. Love this TV.",

    "This is a smart TV about 50% of the time (in my general estimation). You'll be watching something, then the dreaded spinning dots will show up. You wait . . . You turn the TV off, then back on. Samsung has a message about an error. Or no message ever shows up. You wait for the spinning dots to end. It could be five or ten minutes. Sometimes you just turn the TV off and leave because you've waited as long as you can and have to go. It's annoying if you're by yourself and embarrassing if you're with friends. If you mirror from another device you'll probably be ok. The picture is comparable to other TVs on the market. It's lightweight and thin which is great. I just got the spinning dots while writing this.",

    "estoy muy feliz por la comprael tv se ve espectacular una nitides super los videos en 4k son de lo mejor  y coje todas las app",

    "the first one of these I ordered had lines through the right side of the screen. sent that one back got the exact same TV. this television signs out of streaming goes to Samsung streaming freezes screen goes black. spent an hour and a half on the phone with customer support who could do nothing. now I have to send this piece of garbage back. don't buy this product. I was always a Samsung fan, not anymore.",

    "This TV is dope.",

    "My husband and I are both in our 70's. I specifically bought this tv because it had the built in Alexa - to make it easier for my husband. The mic on the remote quit working within the first 2 weeks. My options were :1.Return the tv and mic. (It's too heavy for us to lift, pack or return to the UPS store2. Return the mic to Samsung and be without tv until we received a replacement.3. Take a discount. I did not want the discount; I wanted a working tv with Alexa mic on the remote.I took the discount but will not buy electronics from Amazon again. I was extremely disappointed that Amazon did not support their Alexa mic.  Good lesson here people !!",

    "there was not any directions to hook it up no needed cords. picture was not clear. and not true color.. Will never buy a samsung tv again",

    "The UI is super slow when switching between apps or settings in general, some apps like youtube or hulu will hesitate or not play a video until the tv is rebooted a few times, if it wasent outside the return time I probably would send it back for a better choice.",

    "All good I would buy another, remote is just different than I am used to. They could make it easier to access the batteries.",

    "The remote control takes a bit getting used to.",

    "While it worked was great. Then no picture. We like Samsung and sorry we had to return it. Most likely will buy another one.",

    "Easy to set up and navigate the smart features. Love the remote. Wonderful picture. Will never buy another V - - - o",

    "HDMI Ports 1 and 2 are too small!  I only have one port out of three.",

    "A little on the dark side and cannot get any lighter but does the job of what I need it for",

    "I bought this tv for my husband as an early Father’s Day gift, he loves it!",

    "I did a lot of comparison shopping before I made this purchase.  I read lots of reviews, compared prices, read articles on this and that and the other.  I basically decided this was the best option if I wanted something well reviewed but at the lower end of the price scale.I had somebody else set it up for me, so I can't report on that - but the installer did call me in for setting up some of my accounts/features - and that seemed user-friendly enough.I have yet to use Alexa.  I know...I know... that's surprising, right?  When I do finally get around to it, I will try to remember to update this review.Suffice it to say, the picture quality is good, the features I use seem easy to use, and I'm pleased with my purchase.",

    "Don't waste your money. You'll spend hundreds of dollars for a TV that gives you ads. I paid for a TV, not to become a product.",

    "I do not like because every 30 minutes the screen get black no image at all during 3 to 4 seconds",

    "I needed a new TV to replace my old septre TV. I wanted to get a 4k one since I have an xbox series s. My old septre was a basic HD TV, and the quality wasn't the best.As soon as I finished my set up and turned on my xbox, I could clearly see the immense difference in picture quality. ESO has never looked so good.The games and shows looks so crisps and vibrant on my screen. With a few adjustments I managed to enhance it to make it look even better.The UI is decent enough. I'm still learning everything, since I've never had a smart TV before. I dislike that it came with a bunch of pre-installed apps that I won't ever use, but almost all electronics do that now.At the time of purchase, Amazon was offering a monthly payment plan without having to get the prime credit card, so I paid it off in a few months and now have an awesome TV.",

    "I love the TV picture and the features. The pictures i took dont measure up to actually seeing inperson. At this time I'm not a big fan of the remote.  Maybe I just have to get used to it. The price was a big part of me buying. Was very reasonable.",

    "The picture is more crisp, the colors are more rich, but the smart apps error often, and the remote is too thin. I like the old Samsung remote better, even tho it lacked the smart options.",

    "Smart featuresGreat imagePicture quality is very niceRemote is different but user friendly",

    "I love the picture but the volume sucks can hear it if it’s on 45. Don’t know about smart features yet our internet isn’t available till may",

    "I bought this TV for it's very shallow depth.  Nothing close to the price is as thin.  The only place available for the install was in a spot where a door would partially cover it when open.  Using Samsung's wall mount, the assembly is very shallow (well under two inches) and the door can't hit the TV even when carelessly opened.The display of this TV is very good and the speakers are decent for this size of TV.  I can't say that I am a big fan of Samsung's smart features and range of applications.  I tried using them for a week and then bought an Apple TV to provide the smart functions.  In truth, I have had many smart TVs and I have always found that external streaming devices are a) more capable and b) better supported with updates.",

    "Good Smart TV. Very good picture quality. Sound is Ok. The video and sound doesn’t seem to match up. Tried the Digital Output Audio Delay setting, didn’t work very well. Still has slight delay. Still going through the settings All other TV’s in our house are fine with Audio and Video Syncing. Tried using antenna same problem. Used different cable box still the same.",

    "Bought this for my son as a xmas gift because he is always coveting mine when he come over.  Great TV, for quality and price Samsung rules!",

    "Great picture, vivid colors, excellent TV!",

    "I love. The tv. We had to go to Walmart and get a wall mount",

    "By 4 months, a white line appeared across bottom of the entire screen. Sound goes out intermittently. If tv is paused for any period of time, sound does not come back on. The tv often has to be reset.",

    "Nice and thin and beautiful picture quality, wish I would have gotten one that was a little bigger.",

    "This TV works out perfect for my needs nice picture great for movie night",

    "Samsung de 85realmete excelente TV.  la calidad de la imagen es increible",

    "El tv no tiene 65 pulgadaNo tiene 65 pulgada",

    "Great tv works great with Polk audio sound bar.",

    "This TV is one of the best purchases I've done this year. The smart function is so cool, I was able to download most of the streaming services I use that my google chromecast is virtually useless, I actually haven't used it since I got this TV. The picture is excellent. The remote control is irritating most of the times, but I am getting used to it, and I believe you'll get used too. I followed the recommendation from other buyers and got a Yamaha sound bar (I picked the YAS-109 for free in a promo), and indeed it made it a whole new experience. The built-in speakers were ok until I got a sound bar, then I noticed what the others were saying about the sound quality, but again, it is for home use and it does the job very well. I recommend this product. Ah, the delivery was nice, I selected deliver to door and the UPS lady did a great job (the tv is quite lightweight fyi), and I installed and configured it by myself (I am a 120lbs gal). Hope that helps!",

    "I love my Samsung",

    "Great Picture, remote needs improvements (to small and hard to go between computer and TV source). The TV will find the computer when you plug in the HDR cable. Needs a source button on the remote.",

    "Very pleased with the picture quality. Love watching sports on this behemoth unit.",

    "This Samsung TV is big, fancy, and has a nice high quality picture! However the operating system is not very smooth and it could be slow!",

    "I bought this to replace an older Samsung TV. As usual with Amazon, the delivery was outstanding. Very easy to set up and use. Picture quality is excellent and sound quality is quite good, even without a sound bar. I'm not a gamer, so I don't know how good it would be for that purpose, but for regular TV watching it would be hard to beat this for the price. Arrived in perfect condition with no indication that it had been refurbished (as some people have questioned). Absolutely no complaints and would highly recommend this product.",

    "After spending 45minutes with amazon and then an hour with Samsung, neither accepts responsibility for this 75 tv that was just unboxed and turned on! The box was not damaged and it was carefully unboxed with two people. Just not right. Very, very disappointed and would definitely not recommend!",

    "I was so looking forward to getting this 65” Tv. While I gave it a couple days to adjust the settings and try to fix the pictures and screen. It’s very clear that the TV is defective. The pictures are fuzzy and pixelated especially when it’s a darker image as you can see in the pictures. The black screen also has discoloration like grey bluish patches on it. I’ve tried with BLU-RAY, Netflix and the TVs Samsung tv app and all the pictures look the same despite having Xfinity high speed internet. Very disappointed. Maybe it’s the low refresh rate, I don’t  know, but it sure is not the internet speed. Back to the 10 year old 45” Insignia TV.",

    "It's Samsung, they make great TV's.",

    "Most images looked great, excepet for the dark areas of the movie or video which looked pixeleated like in and old video game from the eighties.",

    "The TV has a fine picture but it has the processing capabilities of a 1983 Texas Instruments calculator. Never in the modern age have I seen a purported “smart” instrument to have such difficulty with the simplest of tasks. I would’ve gladly paid a little bit more for them to put a few more chips in this thing.",

    "I love this TV. it does everything I expected and wanted.  The only thing I haven't been able to figure out is why after I turn it off, it turns itself back on about 5 minutes later.  Sometimes it will do this twice. Sometimes it stays off after the first time.  it's crazy.  lol I've looked and didn't find a timer to turn it back on.  I've changed the batteries on the remote.  It still does it.",

    "Amazon delivered on time all in one piece, remote stinks just ordered reg Samsung replacement 12.99 works like a charm",

    "Great picture. Easy to onstall",

    "Don’t buy for a bedroom it makes a clicking noise constantly when powered off. Customer service was useless.",

    "Muy bomito se ven los colores, también tiene buen sonidoQue tiene muy buena imagen y sonido, lo estoy disfrutando.  El control remoto está demasiado compacto y a veces cuesta buscar como ver la tv y buscar las diferentes contenido que tiene, un poco complicado, poco a poco hay que ir aprendiendo a usarlo",

    "Easy set-up, great picture and colors.",

    "Tv is great...",

    "Image looks great, arrived very well packed",

    "I like this 8 series because it has same features as new samsung tv, way cheaper and very good prices And pictures quality.",

    "I’m no expert on tvs by any means.  I haven’t done any extensive research.  However, after 6 months we still love this television.We did get a soundbar because the sound is not so great",

    "Es una buena tv, realmente es muy grande y la resolución es muy buenaEs una buena tv, realmente es muy grande y la resolución es muy buena",

    "I bought this for my grandmother. She likes it. Picture quality is good. Sound quality, like majority of flat screens are terrible; so, invest in a sound bar or what we do and get bluetooth headphones. Problem solved. This model still uses batteries in the remote.",

    "I got this to update what I had. I’ve only had for a few days but I appreciate all the features, including clear picture, ready accessible network options & price. I hope to enjoy for a few years",

    "The picture on this TV is amazing. Takes a little tweaking but once you get it, you'll love watching it. However, the remote is terrible. The buttons are a bit difficult to figure out.",

    "This was by far a great purchase! Cannot believe this tv works so beautifully! I personally have paid a lot more for much worse product than this reconditioned tv! Picture is terrific as well as all the features. Remote is easy to use and very quick set up. Happy to have decided on this.",

    "I love This Smart TV.No issues at all from Amazon DeliveryNo DefectsNo ScratchesJust Clean Clear picturesIt's like Front Row SeatingAwesomeThanks Amazon",

    "The tv is great and easy set up but the remote is to tiny",

    "I like Samsung. All my computer monitors are Samsung. I bought this TV in anticipation of being a piece of crap to use as background music TV while I work. After maybe the 6th use, the tv would not turn on. I tried all forums and solutions. After contacting US and Eu customer support (which was in comparison to getting stabbed with 1,001 needles at the same time) I found zero support. From what I was found and told - the TV screen burnt out and it needed to be returned/fixed. I have better things to do with my time and money. I left the TV the dumpster and bought a no name brand tv at the same price (BAND NAME DOESN'T MATTER BOISSSSSS) . This will be the last Samsung item I ever buy and will never suggest Samsung to anyone. With regards eff off Samsung.",

    "Picture quality is ok, if you compare with Sony then I would say quality comes with the price, Sony is little expensive and resolution is more perfect than Samsung but I’m happy with Samsung because with my budget I got the great product, easy to use the remote, took the protection plan so I don’t have to think for next 5yrs if anything goes wrong. Overall I would recommend this tv if your budget is this much.",

    "Have never owned a Samsung TV and this is a wonderful surprise.  Such clarity!",

    "It seemed like a nice tv but now that it’s not working and it’s too late to return to Amazon, I am very disappointed and will never buy a tv on Amazon ever again.",

    "Received as a Christmas gift and it failed by the following February.  Pixels failed and then large black streaks within days.  Garbage!  You would assume that an expensive TV should last more than 14 months! Samsung would do nothing past its worthless one year warranty.",

    "Working from home I can split 4 applications into one screen and have all my data in one spot.",

    "I’m so glad I purchased this TV. The picture quality is incredible and the price was great for the size and quality!",

    "Remote is a little tricky take some time to get to know it or you'll get frustrated hitting volume and being sent back to home page",

    "Dislike as in 7 months it suddenly got a line going across the middle of the screen.",

    "Had i mind of its own, which channels, stalled, swithed off, etc... all by itself. Shocking quality for a supposedly known brand. Returned it",

    "Nice looking TV.  Too Many Ads.  It's best to use it as an external monitor or for movies.The constant ads make it trash.",

    "After only a year the TV stop work, the sound started to get glitchy after six months and had to get someone to look at it. Not sure if something was not loose when delivered or what but I think next time I might be purchasing in store.",

    "Lines on TV straight out of the box. Returning.",

    "ENTERTAINMENT.  LEARN CURVE IS THERE, MUST TAKE TIME AND READ TWICE OR MORE...",

    "So far I really like the TV.",

    "We got this 50 inch TV Samsung and it has a beautiful picture. Well packaged and arrived on time and has three inputs for HDMI Which is good and the price was fantastic! It’s a beautiful picture I’ll tell you that!",

    "Great TV, very please with it, but I have returned it and ordered an LG due to the horrible customer service.",

    "Great TV. Beautiful clear UHD picture. Recognizes your hdmi hook ups with little to no programming. Remote is universal for most cable providers. Seamless screen share with your phone. I can find NOTHING wrong with this TV. Would suggest to everyone",

    "WOW HDR pops right out, super sharp 4k",

    "Great image, nice fixtures but when is off make a noise like click click I report this issue to Samsung in have new parts,visit by authorized technical support in my area and yes after the repair work we out noise x les the 24 h that mean the repair don't  solve the problem.",

    "I needed an upgrade from a Vizio 60. So far its been a good investment. Love how thin it is!",

    "This TV is absolutely the best I have ever purchased!",

    "Outstanding color",

    "Great improvement over former Samsung remote controls - this one easy to see and use. The picture quality is super and easily adjusted.",

    "I've owned this 55inch TV for about 5 months now. Now it is $100 cheaper than how much I paid (this makes me mad as I feel like I overpaid).For the feature wise, I do not like the pre-installed internet explorer as I cannot really play a video from a website through that internet explorer. It continuously pauses the video every 1 minute and no one could help me solve this issue. My brother has the similar model from Samsung, but he doesn't have this problem as I do. The return window has closed and getting the replacement is a bit difficulty with returning the one in a box.I enjoy Watchung YouTube, Netflix, HBO, Disney + on this TV, but the internet explorer is not the best thing.",

    "This TV buffers CONSTANTLY and we are in a brand new smart home and have had our internet provider come to check our signal on two occasions only to be told that the problem is with the TV. Save your money and get a Vizio",

    "Purchased this TV after getting an Insignia that was not very good.  Thought the Samsung brand would bring higher quality.  Still did not offer good picture brightness in a very bright room.  Also the audio quality is very poor.  The TV is very think which is nice but seems to be at the sacrifice of the audio quality.  Literally sounds like you are hearing the TV through two cans and a string.  Would not recommend.",

    "It has some burnt out pixels. Gonna attempt to return.",

    "Exceedingly pleased!  Looks like an OLED without the higher price.",

    "The 50-inch screen is large, and the stand legs are only 30 inches apart, so it will fit on most surface tops. That was a concern I had, but I was relieved when I researched to find the distance between the legs was narrow.If your previous tv was a Samsung, it's easy to set up because it loads the previous tv's apps. It's even easier to set up if you have SmartThings on your phone. The whole process from opening the box to installing the legs (the most challenging part but easy) to installation of apps took 30 or fewer minutes.It has very good picture quality. The speakers aren't as good as other Samsung tvs, so you might consider a soundbar. The remote control is slim and easy to use. Other than the speakers, it's great.",

    "Our TV arrived quickly, and the delivery guy even helped hubs carry it into the house. A third person had to help us lift it up into the bracket, but from that point it was easy getting it all set up. Great picture, color, etc. I like the simplified remote. Who needs/uses all those buttons anyway? I would definitely recommend this TV if a friend was in the market.",

    "The picture looks so real!",

    "Loved picture, hated remote. Echo could not find it and could not get tv to recognize roku. Wish they would offer a choice of remotes. Couldn’t. Hide channel I don’t watch or. Find input to get roku to work.",

    "Great Picture and Sound Quality.",

    "This tv's picture quality is top notch!  It is very slim so it doesn't take up much depth in the room. Easy to link my Airpods to and easy to link my DishTV remote to.",

    "This tv is light way and performs just as you’d expect a Samsung to! Great picture, great sound, simple remote and intuitive settings controls! Excellent product.",

    "This is by far the worst tv i have ever owned. The thing is slow, clunky, the remote is terrible. But hey if you want it to take you 5 whole minutes to get to an app by all means get one. Also don't bet on the internet app actually working or being supported by literally any site. All around garbage. Will be returning for refund",

    "I bought it based on that then canceled realizing it was wrong",

    "The TV is awesome. Everything about it is great. I would encourage you to buy a sound bar because the volume doesn’t seem to be different between 20 and 85 and no I do not have hearing issues!",

    "Great TV",

    "Sound quality could be alot better other than that it's the best TV I purchased",

    "It’s very nice, but I should have bought a curved screen, because the glare from daytime windows can really be distracting. Not the TV’s fault. It’s my fault. Otherwise a terrific TV. It’s got everything you could ask for.",

    "Nice TV easy to navigate",

    "Great! Good size, links",

    "My only con on this TV is the blasted Samsung menu system. I would add an Amazon Firestick except for the pain of re-entering all of my login codes.I have discovered that when I stream a 4K video, night scenes are basically black. Why sell a 4K television if you cannot watch 4K?",

    "No complaints at all. Working just fine",

    "ExcelenteExcelente llego en buen estado y funcionando Perfecto",

    "So far like all aspects. Only complain is navigating Samsung tv is a bit confusing at first.",

    "Good",

    "I'm a review person, this TV had highest rating for cost value. I was concerned based on previous reviews with TV being damaged out of box and issues with return.... so upon checkout I saw an option for FREE to have it hand delivered, brought inside, unpacked and included offer to return it if anything wrong with it during delivery process. I loved this option! Delivery guys arrived on time, unpacked TV and turned it on so I could look over it and make sure no physical damage and no unseen screen issues. All was good! I've been enjoying TV for past week no issues. The remote is a bit difficult to navigate but learning. I am happy with my purchase.",

    "This tv was a great choice for my bedroom. Clear picture with a lot of built-in features. The sound is good for me and it is easy to connect other devices.",

    "Just hooked it up and I'm impressed! Quality is amazing for the price.Amazon delivered, carried it in, unpacked, helped me set it on the stand, and took all the trash with them. Very helpful and extremely careful with it.",

    "Several reviews mention a clicking or dripping sound when the TV is off. Don’t know how this TV has such high overall reviews as I have returned two and Amazon wants me to try a third. The first two constantly clicked. Oddly, the sound is noticeable from across the room when the house is quiet at bedtime. It sounds like you have a roof leak dripping. The speakers are poor as well so I recommend the sound bar. The TV is also slow to respond to the remote. This is a major step down from my QLED. The dripping sound makes this TV worthless.",

    "easy to set up.nice picture.okay sound.",

    "The tv is what you would expect, nice sharp picture quality, but the thru the tv sound system leaves a lotto be desired.  Don't know if sound bar would help, but then more $'s needed.  The remote can be confusing,to many activities on to few buttons.",

    "Wanted easy to use TV with good picture.",

    "Lot's of features and easy set-up.",

    "Every 15 minute network disconnect,and remote isn’t working properly now Alexa button is not working  totally money wasted",

    "The picture quality is fantastic. Excellent viewing and user friendly remote",

    "I am disappointed that I got all my apps added to the TV since I am streaming and they are very slow loading and there is buffering while watching something. I got my Roku out and hooked it up and now my new smart TV isn't very smart just like the Sharp that I replaced. All it is good for is the picture and switching between my DVD player, my Roku and my antenna.",

    "I like the TV",

    "This TV is like it’s owner, good not great, so-so, mediocre, and that is fine by medon’t want to be upstaged by my TV anyhow.",

    "Amazing TV, amazing price. But when it is turned off (and still plugged in) this TV makes a weird tick tock noise almost like a clock. I read online this is due to metal parts expanding/contacting due to heat from being on. But it is basically constant? It will make this ticking noise even if it has been turned off for 48 hours straight. It is in my bedroom and wakes me up in the middle of the night sometimes. Very weird. Haven’t decided if I will return it or not.",

    "Didn’t even get the tv that was advertised. Screen cracked and dirty and it was an old tv.",

    "All is good with the tv. The remote control is very touchy. Just the slightest wrong touch and it gets off of set up for Comcast and is difficult to get it back for regular channels.",

    "Bought this on black friday. Seemed legit, but had to return it due to sound issues. Got a replacement, yet the issues persist. I get a crackling/static noise from the speakers when the volume is turned above 14. Not quite what I expected from a 2021 model Samsung smart tv. If you're reading this review, STOP RIGHT HERE. This is NOT the tv you're looking for! Keep on truckin'!",

    "Not disappointed by this tv. It has a great picture and connects well to the Samsung  sound bar I purchased with it.",

    "Love the tv!",

    "This TV has great picture. Very satisfied with this purchase",

    "The tv is pretty good with a very good price.",

    "First tv I have ever had that was larger than the 32 inch I have always had. Can't believe how nice this is.",

    "This is my 7th Samsung HDTV. Like all the others the picture quality is superb! Only aspect I wish Samsung would change is the remote control. Remote controls all features of TV but with far less keys or buttons, you need to go thru more steps than with previous remotes that had numerous keys that made all functions easier to perform. However I use the remote that came with my cable box for 95% of all functions. I HIGHLYBRECOMMEND THIS HDTV. And the Amazon price of under $500 is unbeatable.",

    "Still learning",

    "1) Weird splotchy white colors in blacks, but not all the time.  Always the same area of the TV however.2) Samsung bloat-ware is terrible; auto-play Samsung app is incredibly frustrating.3) Does NOT COME WITH AMBIENT MODE and NO WAY TO ADD IT OR ANYTHING SIMILAR.  You can find dozens, and I mean dozens of articles that say this specific model (AU8000 65) has Ambient Mode.  This specific sub-model sold on Amazon does not have Ambient Mode.4) Remote is terrible.  Tiny buttons, unintuitive design.  Compared to an older LG Magic remote, it's an absolute joke.5) The built in sound is probably not adequate for most people; it's noticeably worse than an older entry level LG and Vizio TVs.6) Operating system is so incredibly laggy, half the time I select the wrong app when first turning the TV on. Again, compared to an older entry level LG or Vizio, this is a joke.7) Samsung forces you into their ecosystem, like with the Gallery app for example.8) TV has connectivity issues to WiFi that none of our other older TVs (or any other device) experience... Even though this TV is the closest device to our router.9) Right out of the box we had to jump through a ton of hoops to get the HBO Max app to not freeze instantly.Good things:1) It really is 1 thin; with a cheap generic thin wall mount it looks greatI wish I had kept the box for this TV and sent it back.  The thinness/depth was our main requirement, but I didn't realize I'd have to sacrifice so much to get it.All of these problems are intentional cost cutting and design choices made by Samsung and are echoed in other reviews - These are not end-user or specific-unit problems.",

    "Excellent picture, smart features respond well, and many apps available. There was no issue with shipping, item was not damaged, and I put this up myself. Although it would have been easier with another person, this is possible with one person who can lift 50 lbs.",

    "Took it out the box, plugged it up & it didn’t turn on. Unplugged and replugged, turned on but only lines across it like the screen was broke or something.. didn’t work, disappointed.",

    "Alexa will only respond to technical orders, ie: Alexa, go to HDMI 1. It will not go-to channels. Once the order is given, Alexa, go to Netflix. It repeats the request but doesn't go to the station.  This would be a major inconvenience to send this back so I have an Apple TV and when I want to go to steamers, I switch to that and then can use the voice activation.  I am still trying to find a Samsung tech support person to help as getting through Samsung is in itself a mess.",

    "The tv its self is very nice, the smart tv function can get a bit laggy at times but over all a very nice picture. The tv remote is junk.",

    "I bought this TV to replace an older 60-inch Samsung with which I was very pleased.  I bought this in order to cut the cord and rely on streaming.First, and most important: It is my only TV or device of any kind, that does not seem to be able to keep a wifi connection in order to stream shows.  It is in my family room.  I have TVs in 3 bedrooms and they all do fine (they are all different, older model Samsungs, BTW).  I upgraded my FIOS connection to 1GB to handle the move to all streaming, but it has made it worse.  Verizon has checked (and I have verified) that the connection into the house is fine.  I would blame the distance from the router, except that my phone, iPad and laptop all are able to stream content just fine in the same room as this TV, while the TV just buffers constantly and often (I mean like all the time) just drops the connection, saying network error  and try again.  It does actually receive a signal, because I have occasionally been able to watch a show., though not usually all the way through.  This alone has me wanting to go back to cable, though that. still means this TV is terrible.Secondly, the UI is not intuitive at all.  I subscribed to YouTubeTV, and it buried the app somewhere in the third screen after sign-in.  You have to put up with Samsung TV when you turn it on, and then search around for your preferred apps every time.  I finally figured out how to move it to the first screen, but there doesn't seem to be a way to get rid of the Samsung start content.  When you add this to the fact that just scrolling through to find the app you want as the TV buffers and stops, is enough to tear my hair out.  I have liked Samsung TVs for a long time, but I don't know what they've done here.  Not smart.  Really really sucks.  I am not a techie, but I am not a Luddite either, and I have managed all my devices and connections for years and have even been able to troubleshoot them pretty well.  I spent a long time on the phone with tech support (clearly not in this country) and the very nice gentleman suggested that I do a reboot by holding down the power button till the TV went off and then on again.  This worked ok that one time and the TV seemed to (sort of) improve a little, but within the hour it was buffering again and going off.  I now reboot it regularly and it does nothing to help.  I realize the date for return is passed (by about ten days only) and I really am not up for a fight, but never Samsung again.",

    "muy buena comprabuena elección por la adquisición del tv, buena imagen, buen sonido",

    "TVmuy buen producto excelente vendedor gracias",

    "Great value! Best smart TV I've ever had. Picture makes it feel like your in same room as people on TV. Live this",

    "Overall it is a great tv. However, there is a tapping sound coming from the tv when powered off. It almost sound like a ticking clock. It’s pretty annoying being that it’s a tv i purchased for me bedroom that i have to hear ticking through the night.",

    "Replaced a 12-yeard old Samsung so the step up in picture quality and features is really noticeable for me. So far I love it! Thought about a cheaper TCL but Samsung earned my loyalty with the way their last TV performed.",

    "This is the most expensive tv I've ever purchased, but the picture is great.  It is also easy to operate.  We purchased a sound bar because the speakers are in the back of the tv.  I would recommend this tv, but buy a sound bar.",

    "alexa feature",

    "I am VERY particular about picture amd sound quality. So let me tell you when people are complaining about the picture being grainy and this and that, it just means they didn't spend any time adjusting the picture. I spent about 15 mins trying different picture settings and this thing is absolutely IMMACULATE. I've never seen a better picture in my life. Yeah the audio isn't much but the thing is only an inch thick! What do you expect?!? I added a Yamaha sound bar and this is by far the best picture a.d sound combination out there for less than 1000 bucks. Just buy it, have patience, tailor it to your liking and you will definitely not be disappointed. I will say when I first turned it on, it wasn't a very clear picture, but after a couple tweaks and leave it on for about an hour and you'll be just as stoked as I am. The remote sucks but whatever. Get a universal one so you can just use one for everything and you're good to go. Im recommend to anyone I know im the marker for a new 4k smart TV. Samsung does NOT disappoint. We'll just have to see how long it lasts....",

    "Easy to set up with an outstanding picture",

    "Never seen a Television this thin, no air vent in the back, dust (KILLS!!) electronics. The remote is just (TOO) easy to use, straight forward and gets the job done. The legs were just (TOO) easy to install, just push them right into the back and snap. The picture was washed out and pale, with a few adjustments really beautiful for a TV in this price range. The sound is really good, could use a (LITTLE) bass, but for a slim/tiny/micro width TV this is great. If you play with it a bit, can look/sound like a $1,000.00 television. I am really satisfied with this purchase.",

    "Read the whole review there are a lot of twists and turns.I purchased this 85 inch Samsung TV about a month ago. So far, absolutely loving this thing. My first smart TV, it is really great. It connected to my WiFi router without issue, though mine is close by so I can't speak to the range of it. The onscreen interface is excellent, you can log into all your various channels, Prime, HBOmax, Youtube etc. It also has some built in TV channels for some free movies if you have no other pay channels. I integrated this with a really old Dish box that works well by using air channel 3 via coax cable. One shocker to me is how well this TV picks up air channels like the local news stations. I had not expected that. The picture quality is phenomenal. Bright, crisp. The viewing angles are really good as well. The built in speakers are really good too, I'm sure the sound bar only improves things but I did not opt for that.  I also do not have Alexa so I can't speak to the integration of that feature. If the TV has any Achilles heels its lack of any composite or analog inputs or outputs other than on coax jack. Coming from an old Mitsubishi DLP TV, my DVD player, VCR and external speakers are out in the cold right now. There are probably some work arounds but basically if it doesn't have a HDMI jack or WiFi, it's going to require some additional equipment to make it work.  You can use the coax input for legacy equipment , but only one at a time. For most people that don't have ancient equipment and DVDs and tapes, its not going to be an issue. A simple coax switcher could probably solve that problem easily. The only other issue is the remote. It's a bit odd in its operation. It's very minimalist and small, and probably to a fault. The thing that baffled me initially was that the rocker that you would normally associate with up and down volume actually pushes up (from the side) for that function. You push it down for mute. Once you get the hang of it, it works well but its not readily apparent how it works. I had to look it up online to figure it out. Other than that, the 4 way control pad is responsive and allows you to navigate the various channels with ease. Overall, very happy with this TV.Edit: Fast forward to June 2022, 6 mos later give or take, the TV has developed a horizontal line (3 lines to be exact, closely spaced) on the screen. I have tried unplugging to reset the screen but thus far the line problem remains. Totally changed by opinion of Samsung and this TV. New rating...1 star. If your products break after 6 months, you are making junk, plain and simple. I have a Sony CRT TV that's 25 years old, looks as good as the day I bought it. So yeah, probably should have bought a Sony. If you are buying one of these, just be aware that this can happen. It's an expensive purchase so I would recommend getting the warranty. I foolishly did not.  I do have a couple of options I will be looking at. But regardless, the TV went from a joy to a hassle and who needs that? There's cheaper options out there, if it's just going to break and be junk, why pay more for Samsung junk?UPDATE: I was very disappointed with Samsung because of the screen issue. They REPLACED the whole TV at 0 cost. I don't think you can stand behind your products any stronger than that. Hopefully this one will fair better than the first one. I am feeling pretty satisfied at this point. Make sure you register your TV for warranty and it will be honored. Changing my review to 4 stars. Ideally the TV would not fail but the fact that they stood behind the product and made it right, well that's a quality company.",

    "picture is good but too dark, no setting will change that. there is a constant clicking noise from the TV when it is off, it can drive you insane. it seems to support webcam but only very expensive models. settings can be a headache and the remote control is very primitive and confusing, I still don't know what those 123 and the color buttons do.",

    "Really great tv for the price",

    "The biggest issue I have is the controller. Its worthless. and the voice assist is stupid. I tell it to switch inputs 50x before the idiot finally realizes the NO i dont want to watch whatever it randomly thought i wanted, i want it to change inputs so i can game. it takes entirely too long to tell it to work, and the controller's sole purpose is honeslty to serve as a microphone for it. I wont make this mistake again, no more smart tvs. they're dumb. Next time Ill just get a regular tv that doesnt come with a bunch of broken features.",

    "Great",

    "TV is leaning against the wall because I have no way to attach it to the wall mount. Samsung was too cheap to include the 4 screws needed. The ones from my prior TV do not fit the Samsung.",

    "I'm glad that I didn't let the negative reviews outweigh the positive ones. We replaced a 12 year old Visio TV of the same size. So, to us, the 4k picture quality is a stunning improvement. Setup was simple. I'm running audio through my Pioneer receiver and have a Dolby Atmos setup. Sound quality is excellent. One thing that I learned during the setup: I had an old hdmi cable attached and when I first powered up, I was seeing some intermittent screen flickering. I changed it out with a new cable rated for 8k @160hz and all is well. Overall, I would recommend this TV to anyone. Great product at a great price",

    "great picture easy set up my third samsung  tv and i would buy another",

    "Easy to set up and very reliable",

    "My husband uses this monitor and says he loves it, that it's the best he's ever had. He loves the curve and the size (it is very big). The picture quality is amazing.",

    "I love the functionality, and the big picture, automatically switches to game mode, great sound",

    "I’m not that picky when it comes to sound but this sounds super cheap and tin-y. Also it defaults to annoying advertisements and shows that you can’t get off the screen in the default settings. Starts off playing with a soap opera affect, I hope you know how to get that crap off. It tried to make create a stupid account, just what you need, another account and passwords and BS just to watch your TV. The remote is super slow working to navigate the menu because it doesn’t have any memory. I owned a little older Samsung and it was great. This is garbage. I’m planning on spending the extra time to shove this junk back in the box and return.",

    "Bought this t.v. three times, and still screwed over. I ordered the 50’ and it arrived very late, over a week late, plugged it in, the screen  has no pictureno visible damage but no picture. Process a replacement order and paid a neighbor to help me get it to UPS store as I don’t drive as I’m physically disabled plus I live three stories up and the tv is too heavy and bulky to manage three flights on my own. Shove it in an Uber drive to UPS and back so paid $30 to have it taken to return. Got tracking info on my replacement and it took twice as long to get as it took mine to return to them.I patiently wait for the tv, it’s the only one I purchased and going on 3 weeks of original order when I’m watching on my tracking app my driver is 10 stops away, 2stops away. Here! Yeah. I give it a few minutes to go to the communal mailroom for my t.v.finally it’s here, I’ll have a tv and I’m excited despite all going wrong it’s overbut no. It gets worse.I get to the mailroom right after my Alexa informed me my package has arrived. I go down the three floors and around the corner to the lockers where packages that won’t fit in your mailbox go where I live knowing it won’t fit in a locker it’ll be in the large box open area abs no t.v? What’s going on here. The management office processes your deliveries that go here as you’re  given a code via text that  you enter to unlock one of the lockers which holds your item(s) and go on your own way. So I ask the office if they stashed a tv, they say that rug came for you no tv thoughrug, wait what? I live in a studio apartment under 400sqft. I have one 2x3 that fits here and it looks huge. I’m trying to process how the heck Amazon missed a 50” tv for a 12x12 giant ass rug? How does this happen Amazon. SKU’s similar? A different tv maybe but a f’n ballroom size rug, how many people neglected to do their job for this to have happened.Now here’s the problem, I can’t leave the rug there. You must remove your packages in communal areas immediately and if stollen, they aren’t responsible, I am. I have to drag this monster and shove it in the elevator, drag it (I’m 105lbs 5’7 ) over an entire block to my door and try and navigate it without damaging anything when it’s bigger than my whole apartment. I can’t do UPS pickup here either so I have to get an Uber and pay $28 to return this nightmare tv Amazon fiasco on my dime. I don’t have a plethora of them I’m sure you figured by now. Being petty but I don’t have a printer either so I had to pay a dollar too to print the labelagain this is Amazons mistake you guys. I’m just on the hook for $527 here if this rug isn’t back to them right away. So second trip to UPS returns store now, no tv still I’m prime but it’s taking unusually long to get to me I figured the rug would too to get to them as well but get a notification they are just processing my returned broken tv I sent back two weeks prior so I’m being charged for the tv sent as replacement for rug till rug in.Well rug got there over three weeks ago and I’m still waiting on my $527and who’s paying me back for expenses I incurred for their not doing their job properlynot them of course. Nope.Wish I could say it got better but the new replacement tv is jacked up too by shutting off randomly and the remote or tpv (both) don’t communicate but half the time. It’s not batteries, I replaced those but the thing only responds to remote after pressing command button and waiting, toggling 20 seconds to reply to commandalways dropping internet, I’ve seen the “We’re Sorry, something must have gone wrong image with puss and boots more than any show I’ve tried to stream on this tv yet all my other devices have no lag or connection issues. I owned the identical in 43” and it worked just fine but I liked it so much when I moved I purchased that model as I thought I knew it was good..not the case here. . Also this particular dud won’t pair Amazon Echo Studio sound come on now. I had to pay twice for this crappy ass tv and go through all that b.s. for this and still waiting for my over $500 return people of Amazon! and you haven’t even refunded me yet in three weeks after I followed all your directions as you required me to for your problem in first place, your faulty products, your love literally traumatized me in fear of trying to return this dud of a tv but must be asking too much for a working one.I want my refund processed asap guys and you to finally take care of getting me a proper, new in box, working tv as I ordered. Okay, I think that’s the least you can do.",

    "I'm a huge fan of Samsung TV's.  I know they cost a little more but the quality seems to be really good.  I have 5 Samsung TV's in various rooms of my house and garage and they all get great picture quality and last a long time.",

    "Excellent picture. Remote is small, clean and very useful. Only problem is I have sound running to a Yamaha soundbar and every time I adjust volume, a graphic pops up on left hand side of television screen showing Yamaha Optical. Very annoying.",

    "I bet I can't tell this picture from the $2400 model. It is a fine TV. I bought a 15 degree tilt wall mount and the TV center line is up about 15 degrees . That allows it to be up and safely off the floor yet viewed from a recliner is at optimum. The picture and motion are awesome and, I can hear it OK, but, a soundbar will be in my future. I am very glad I got this one.",

    "Beautiful TV. Loved it for the 2 weeks that we had it before the a line formed on the TV.  I've looked at other samsung TV reviews and this seems to be a common problem. I will not be purchasing another Samsung.",

    "Love my new Samsung Tv",

    "I love the TV. The remount has always been a lil off.",

    "Great smart TV. Only bother is I need to buy a sound bar because I cannot control the TV with my Altice One cable remote. It will not pair.",

    "We trouble shot the open box tv remote batteries and power source.Contacted Samsung. Something is wrong. Need to return it vs having technician come to house. Covid widespread up here. Noted, it came days early and was sitting on porch in freezing weather. Should have texted.",

    "The tv is awesome! Great picture and quality! Not bad for the price! Although if you’re mounting the tv on the wall, make sure to have to people because the tv is large and very heavy!",

    "these is the absolute worse tv u can buy the picture is so faded it is horrible if u move a little bit to side of tvalso a lot of channels are faded when are in front of picture. i would purchase any other brand customerservice lied to me as welli will never purchase any sansung product ever again. i have purchased two televisions in the past but this experience has taught me a lessonNEVER BUYSAMSUNG",

    "TV arrived ahead of schedule!  Took 30 minutes to set up.  A great picture and sound quality.  Still cannot decide which is better, a soundbar or the speakers from the actual TV.  Use this with internet connection only streaming Hulu Live.  Because of the size, had to put it on a wall that is behind where the modem is.  I was concerned that the signal would be interrupted, however no issues with lag time or any service.  I did a ton of research on the next size up when thinking of buying a new tv.  Samsung has always been my go-to tv.  This one does not disappoint.  The price was good and so far the only thing negative I have to say is I wish the remote was backlit, it would make it much easier to hit the correct button.  If you are looking for an upgrade to a larger tv I would recommend this one.",

    "Samsung",

    "Great TV at this price point. Great smart features and picture. Love it.",

    "The TV is great other than the issue with the bulb which creates these white blotchy looking things all over the screen, extremely noticeable in dark images.  In the midst of my second return.  I had read after the fact that this is a known issue with these TV’s.  Of note, the exchange/return process wasn’t too cumbersome.  I just took the TV off of the Mount and they brought in the new one and took the old one.  Unfortunately, I had to return that one too for the same issue.",

    "We have this TV in a smaller size for our bedroom and recently decided to upgrade our projector back to a nice TV. This TV is humongous. I don't think I realized how large it was until we set it up. Either way, it's nice and the picture quality is great. It is quick to turn on and has some nice features.",

    "Easy to set up. This TV has great picture quality. The only downside is a lot of movies and channels don't display the whole picture on the entire screen. But that's not the problem of the TV. Like having a movie theater in your home.",

    "I like it awful expensive for what it is Year old TV",

    "Numerous features and all installations are working very well including installation of Amazon FireStick and streaming.  Picture is very clear, including sound.  Kudos to seller.",

    "Decent tv but needs a fire stick to get all the apps I wanted",

    "Excelente.Excelente y fácil de configurar",

    "Image quality is decent for the price, and so is the design. It's definitely thin and has a small vesel. It also has a very well designed remote. However, it has a few problems:1) For some reason, I can hear something ticking inside the TV after I turn it off. It's lasts up to 3 minutes. It's pretty annoying at night. I don't know if it's a fan or something else.2) Can't add the TV to my Samsung SmartThings account. It tries to register and just spins. I've tried a bunch of times and it always fails.3) Can't add a smart assistant. Both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa failed to connect, and so can't integrate it to a smart home setup.I tried updating the software, but says it's on the latest.Basically, you get what you pay for. I own a Samsung Frame TV and the software behaves as expected. This is supposed to be the same OS, but it fails.",

    "Tv lasted for 1 week and screen went black. Disappointed in the product.",

    "The TV is super slow. Changing a channel take s a few seconds between each one. Owned for less than a month and it wouldn't turn on.Two days outside of Amazons return window and now I have to wait a week for a guy to come with new parts to fix a brand new TV i spent $1800 on. Junk.",

    "In the current market with high-end TV's forcing glass size ever larger, the low end is seeing fantastic side effects from those expensive TV's, of note is the AU series which has an incredible size to cost ratio. Just 2 years ago a 75 inch tv with worse picture quality would have been $2k and now it can be had for $1k. Just absolutely incredible. The picture quality is absolutely top tier as far as displays without local dimming zones go. But of course the sound is just absolutely awful, a joke really. The operating system is a bit laggy but serviceable. Overally it's just good to see the focus put on the picture quality which is all that matters. If you hook up a purpose built streaming box and some real speakers this tv can really shine. And with it's faults you can not blame it too badly as it does what it was meant to do extremely well and that is to display an image. So yeah marketing says it's all in one but it's not, but that doesn't stop it from being just a really good display that I would absolutely recommend.",

    "Delivery was good but I’m Missing power cord. Didn’t realize it until I was setting up",

    "we open the box today and it is broken",

    "This product came a day early, and was easy to setup.  Very happy with this purchase.",

    "Box had been opened. Dirty finger prints on everything, Someone had entered their email address into the TV system. Batteries were installed in the remote control so I left it that way.Box was torn, but no damage to TV. Remote control had difficulty pairing with the system.",

    "It shouldn’t be so complicated to pick up a remote and turn up the volume. The button on the mute or unmute the TV. There’s obviously something I’m doing wrong but surely this TV volume goes above 15. It’s very frustrating that such a simple thing is so complicated.",

    "This TV has good features, but the Wi-Fi keeps cutting off, I must turn off the TV and restart in order to regain back the connection, and in some cases I have to reset the Network all together.",

    "easy TV set up with Samsung App. perfect picture quality. Very Happy!",

    "I bought this for my bedroom. The 43 inches are more than enough in there (I'd go with at least 55 if it was in the living room). The sound is good. If someone complains about the sound it's because it doesn't have a booming bass. That's okay... I don't want a booming bass in the bedroom. The picture quality is really good... And as someone who shies away from technology just for the heck of it, I was really surprised by how easy it was to set up.I ran my hdmi from my computer to this, and while the picture quality is better when just used as a  television, I really like it as an over sized monitor.",

    "So I've always bought a TV in a store. This was my 1st time ordering one online.No issues when receiving the TV. No cracks or anything. I always buy Samsung since I never have issues with them.Love that I can connect my Bluetooth headphones to it.The only complaint about this TV is the remote. It's awkward and can easly hit the buttons when grabbing it. Not an issue to take a star off though.**photo is an 80s movie - to show picture quality**",

    "Pict not clear and behind on videos",

    "It literally took me 45 minutes to setup our services. Some which allow you to use your phone...dont work quite so well. TV quality is very high.",

    "Basically better then any other smart TV easy setup light for a 65 inch",

    "I love this TV. I knew it would be big but it was alot bigger then I thought. Which is not a bad thing. I recommend to anyone looking for a very large tv with great features.",

    "Always loved Samsung products",

    "Second one of this model I get. The first one developed white shadow spots in several areas of the screen. This one now turned back on the left half of the screen after second day of use. There won’t be a third one.",

    "After 1 month no complaints. For me the true test will be how long it lasts. It seems like a quality item.",

    "Had some minor screen color issues after one month. Had to reset the tv to fix. System very slow sometimes shut down itself. Now completely broken, cant turn it on, screen flashes black and white, and it has past the return window, ive only used it 4 months. Worst tv i have purchased.",

    "Todo bienTodo está exelente",

    "great picture and colors",

    "Everything was great",

    "TV has been making these knocking noises, almost drip like when it is turned off. I’ve had 2 technicians come and replace parts and it has not worked. It’s distracting & annoying especially in the middle of the night. Beware before buying.",

    "The wi-fi connection is really bad. No matter what streaming service we use, the wi-fi keeps cutting out. We thought it was our internet provider, we went through so much trouble shooting, had comcast reps out several times. When they couldn’t figure out any issues, we tried using our old TV- no problems there. The issue is this TV. So frustrating. What good is a smart TV that doesn’t stay connected to the internet.",

    "This is one of the BEST TV I ever bought so far. The picture is perfect and the remote works well I recommend it 100% CRYSTAL CLEAR and wOw love it",

    "Love this TV. I got 85inches. Picture quality is very good and colors are vibrant! Very happy with this purchase.",

    "Very clear",

    "Picture is great, sound delivery to soundbar via HDMI ARC is great. My only complaint is that when the power is off, a ticking sound emanates from its rear. Based on my research, many others have experienced this problem and it usually fades after a few months. In the meantime, it's in my bedroom and the noise is very noticeable while trying to get to sleep. This will be my last Samsung TV.",

    "I love this TV! I'm a loyal fan of Samsung TVs, this lived up to my States of an upper kids grade Samsung. Value + price = happy customer.",

    "It was way too big so I did not  even un pack it.  It was supposed to replace an Insignia TV I bought from Amazon  last summer which is a complete piece of trash,  Because of the size I had to return the Samsung but I have Samsung in other parts of the house and they all work great.  All I can say about this insignia is The devil made me do it.  Best Buy supplies the customer service and frankly life is too short to put up with them and their BS.",

    "Very satisfied with this TV",

    "Samsung siempre dándonos lo mejorTodo lo que necesitas, buen tamaño,  nitidez, práctico, inteligente.. gracias Samsung",

    "Seemed real good until I turned it off,. Sounded like a fan was running and clicking against something. Sent it back. Still waiting for the refund. And legs simply snap in, which was nice. But Bixby assistant doesn't understand much.",

    "ez to set! up beautiful quality picture and sound :D",

    "This TV had a fantastic picture, but the sound is absolutely horrible.  Thankfully you can connect a Bluetooth speaker to overcome it.  Overall, good value for the price. We bought it for the bedroom.",

    "Smart",

    "Beautiful TV, sound pic and very easy setup, specially for gamers",

    "The first tv I received was defective didn’t notice the defect until I got the TV set all the way up in my room the same day it arrived there was discoloration all across the tv screen .. I immediately reported the issue to Samsung and of course they were no help i ended the call after a few minutes of being on the phone with them and came back to amazon to order a replacement I just received my replacement today and it came in perfect condition no defects I was so nervous that the replacement would defective too but thankfully it wasn’t thank you amazon!! ❤️",

    "First time ordering a tv and it was great. Love my brand new tv.",

    "I kicked my ex out who would play video games non stop and wouldn’t let me watch tv in the living room ever. So when he left he told me I could keep the old tv. Which I was ecstatic. Finally had couch time. Then he decided to take the tv since he saw my joy with it. So I decided to majorly upgrade with this one. Couch time has never been better. And just another excuse for my ass to stay at home and watch every lord of the rings and every show known to man. I love it. So much. Best purchase of the year. Easy as hell to setup. And super good quality.",

    "I regret purchasing this TV (used). It has very bad sound quality. Old mount from previous Samsung TV did not match this TV. It was not possible to set it up TV with phone option but only through remote control. It was impossible to insert power cord after TV mounting. You have to do it before.",

    "I was buying Samsung Smart TV 2021 model, but when I turn on TV setting it was showing 2015. How is it happened?",

    "Picture and sound are great",

    "very good quality",

    "I bought the 43 inch 4K/60 version of the Samsung AU8000 to use with my PS5. The picture quality is fantastic and I'm really enjoying the improvement that the HDR brings over my old TV. The sound quality is pretty good for built-in speakers and noticeably better than in my old 1080p. Overall a good quality starter 4K tv.Edit: I did previously have some issues with small popping and cracking sounds from the speakers but with some further research I found a solution through some settings changes on my PS5. Because it was not actually the TV causing the issue I am changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars.",

    "I don't like that Alexa doesn't work all the time, I want to speak what I want to see on my tv at all times, that's Not happening.",

    "It would not turn on at first. I had to unplug and wait several times but at last it worked. Love the voice control feature.",

    "Makes super load clicking noise when turned off",

    "TV has a backlighting problem, seems to be very common. White blotches on black backgrounds. Tried to watch a movie and the black bars on the top and bottom were filled with the white clouds. Ordered a replacement, but if it continues will return for a refund. Unacceptable manufacturing defect.",

    "home use.",

    "The picture is good. The software is slow and clunky. Pressing buttons on the remote is followed by waiting endlessly for the tv to catch up. The combination of the software and remote is terrible.  What should take one button press to accomplish takes four.",

    "This was our second TV because the first one was defective out of the box. The first issue with the replacement TV came when we discover that the screen was separating from the frame along the side. Recently we find the volume went away. Increasing the volume did little to increase the sound. Then the next time we turn it on that changed to a loud crackling sound that you could not turn down. So over all this has been the WORST TV we have ever purchased and I would recommend avoiding these Samsung TVs. For us this TV has been an absolute waste of money and time. I expected much better quality from Samsung but have been nothing but disappointed with the quality of this TV.",

    "Out four year old Sony didn't survive the move to our new house well and it only really worked with Roku for streaming anyway, so a new TV was in order. When we looked at TV's and saw what was available for under $1000 we were blown away at the quality. Samsung was out favorite and at the price point in the mid six hundreds our decision was easy. Outstanding picture and  great sound, easy to use and with a processor that keeps up with the fasted motion. Also Samsung does not manufacture in China which for us is a big plus. Overall this was a great purchase and one we'd make again - we love it.",

    "Finally got the TV even the package itself was good it had no damages it was easy to set up and use thanks you very much",

    "I was a little concerned about this TV after reading the reviews, but the TV is awesome for the price. No complaints so far. If I notice something wrong, I will come back and edit this review.",

    "NO recomendable para latinoamérica ya que tiene funciones solo para USANO cuenta con alexa, NO cuenta con asistente de google, solo cuenta con bixby una aplicación no tan buena comparada con alexa. Solo te sirve para abrir aplicaciones, algunos comandos basicos y las funciones de youtube pero nada mas que eso, para latinoamérica esta televisión es muy diferente a lo que se vende en la descripción",

    "A very good product! Nice picture quality but it needs an external speaker system!",

    "The TV itself it’s pretty good! It has all streaming services, and love that has alexa integrated.Sometimes I feel like there is a background process running because sometimes when you press a button in the controller until you see it on screen! It’s incredibly slow! Or even selecting the app, slow.But some other times works pretty good!",

    "Me encantaEl que yo estaba buscando me encanta gracias Amazon",

    "Remote is slow to respond making it difficult to navigate thru apps. Many apps included with tv that I do not want but can’t get rid of. Voice response on remote is useless. It just does not respond as it should. Picture on tv often freezes or goes blank. I would never buy this tv again. In fact I would love to return it and get a refund.",

    "I wasn’t even able to set the tv up once I turned it on. Buttons would not respond on remote, everything was wrong with it I’m just too pissed to type everything in detail.never again",

    "All is good except the remote.  it is too small for a man's hand to use without constantly looking at it.  It is long and skinny and black and easily misplaced and/or dropped. It lacks some of the usual buttons depending on Amazon's Alexa often. Alexa is sometimes befuddled as to your request. When contacting Alexa you lose the sound as she takes over. I would prefer a larger and heavier remote control, preferably in bright orange, with lighted buttons. Based on the inability of Alexa on this remote control, I will never buy any Alexa items from Amazon.",

    "Great picture, sound is ok. Smart features pretty good!",

    "TV work great until Samsung up gradedProgram over night still having issues withSamsung and Spectrum apps",

    "I absolutely love it. Crystal clear screen, easy install, not too heavy (1 person lift if careful)I am ecstatic about my purchase.",

    "Samsung is pretty much the only brand of TV I’ll buy but this may change it.As you can see in my photo, there are two dark lines on the bottom left of the screen.I realize this could just be a lemon but there are other issues.I like using my Amazon Firestick for all my streaming. I don’t need Netflix, Disney, HBO, etc., on the actual TV. However, I cannot remove them. Whenever I go to select a source I have sift through a list of apps that I really don’t want on my TV.Also, the sound is horrible. These speakers aren’t even as good as what you would find at Five Below.Definitely going with a different brand.",

    "I got this to replace a 39” lg tv in my bedroom. As I am essentially bedridden, I wanted a larger tv for virtual travels, but also have limited space.  This 50” samsung smart tv is perfect for my needs.  I have a fire stick and xfinity flex plugged into it, though with the samsung tv feature, wouldn’t need them.  I can control everything with the samsung remote. I tweaked the picture to suit my tastes, and am very happy with the quality, especially when watching in 4k.  However, everything looks good on it.  The sound took tweaking and getting used to.  The volume i used my old tv on was 7 to 12.  This one is graded differently, so that for same volume I use numbers 25 to 40.  I may add a sound bar at some point for greater control and listener satisfaction, but it does work ok as is.The tv is very stable, beautifully thin, with very thin frame. Getting it started was a conundrum at first, but once I found the only button on it, it turned on and was easy to set up.  Also extremely easy to connect the flex and fire stick and bluray player.Overall I am very satisfied and would purchase again.",

    "This TV can not hold a WiFi connection more than a few hours, then in order to get it working again I've had to completely reboot my home router.  Then a few hours later, have to go through it again.  Don't waste your time or money on this junk item",

    "Grandiosa Television!!!!Me gusto mucho esta TV es muy buena la calidad de imagen en muy clara y el tamaño tambien es perfecto para mi sala, el sonido también es muy claro y nitido se y lo que mas me gusta es que viene con alexa incluido. Y el control es un pequeño micrófono que puede controlar el televisor es grandioso que hayan incluído esa característica!! La entrega fue muy segura y a tiempo  muy cuidadosa tambien.",

    "Literally turns on and shuts off randomly",

    "Super slow. Freezes all the time. Would not recommend this TV. Previous model way better.",

    "Had to return first one.  Thanks Amazon. Five months later it’s cutting off every hour and I have to shut it down and restart.  Horrible quality.",

    "We've only had it two days and normally I wait a little while to write reviews but very pleased so far.  We had a 9 year old very thin LG tv that was great.  It finally started getting lines in the picture so we decided to upgrade.  We spent a lot of money on the old tv but wanted a more budget friendly tv this time around but I just can't stand those clunky looking 4-5 thick tv's hanging so far off the wall.  I realize most people will be way more concerned with picture quality but this tv also looks great.  For a non oled tv this thing is very thin and looks great on the wall.  The old one lasted 9 years so the bar is set pretty high.  Only time will tell, but so far so good.",

    "I got a pretty good deal on this tv on Black Friday and overall it’s a good tv however I’m constantly turning the wifi setting off on the tv and turning it back on because of a error. Mind you I have very good 5g wifi so that’s not the issue and all my other devices don’t have a issue so it’s the tv. It’s pretty annoying even turning the tv off won’t fix it I literally have the turn the wifi off and turn it back on. I’ve never had a Samsung do this I’ve had a few over the years this is the first one and here I thought this was a very good series",

    "This tv is perfectly clear and easy  to set up.  What more do you need?  For me nothing.  I would recommend this tv.",

    "Sound was too low.",

    "Great.",

    "It's great",

    "Setup was a bit of a challenge but samsung customer service was exceptional.  Picture quality is really great.",

    "It has changed our football days!",

    "The only major issue with this Samsung TV is that the remote is lacking functionality!",

    "Easy setup easy to use and great picture quality. Exceeded my expectations so far. Just not happy the price lowered $50 dollars probably within 2 weeks of my purchase. Been looking at this tv for 6 months, should have waited 2 weeks 🙄 more?",

    "De lo mejor 👍🏻",

    "Picture quality is excellent. The remote is unlike others but easily adapted to it. The sound quality is fair however I am not sure if it’s the TV or streaming service",

    "Amazon has a mixed bag of reviews for TVs and some people having damaged on delivery or buying new but getting a refurbished one,  so I really crossed my fingers and ordered.I have a 7 year old Samsung flat screen 50 inch TV I have loved, and bought new on sale from a store, so naturally I wanted another Samsung.This one has similar but upgraded smart features as my old TV but it was so much thinner! The screen and quality of the picture were good, I’m not a gamer or a big critic of picture quality so I can’t say if it was Ultra HD but it’s clear, beautiful and easy to setup. Hooking up Alexa to it was but more involved, and there’s this new smart app they want you to download but is not necessary (I couldn’t get the TV to connect to it)I have a sound bar and surround system so when I used the speakers on the TV initially I did notice the lack of quality I’m used to, but I’ve had a quality home sound system for years.Over all for watching TV and movies in very pleased with the product and hope it lasts as long as my old TV.",

    "I thought 85 would be too large. We have a large great room and it works really well. We've overall been very happy with this purchase. Uses about 120 Watts or 0.6 kWh. The smart features don't allow some apps like my standalone Roku, but other than that, we've had no complaints. We did buy a sound bar to get better sound.",

    "Not so happy with it it’s not what I expected",

    "Ease of use practical ,great pictures. Easy on your eyes,  worth the moneyIntuitive to use.",

    "Sounds quality is nowhere near LG TVs, I would not recommend this TV",

    "Perfect for my home office.  Electric cord was extremely short but overall a great price",

    "We had a very nice 50 Samsung and got this one as an upgrade. It is very easy to set up and the on-screen guides you right to everything you need. Makes sure you know Alexa, Prime, NetFlixs, etc. logins before you begin and that will make it even easier.IF you are using a home theater system, make sure you plug in the ARC HDMI and then the remote should control all of your device if plugged in and on.So far, the picture quality is great and the smart online features are easy to use. We'd buy another if we needed it.",

    "I got this as a birthday gift to myself. There were some issues with shipping, but eventually I got it! This is a great TV. The picture quality is excellent and the smart features seem to be really good! Set up was pretty easy through the remote (I had some issues with the app).My one concern: this TV is SO thin. I like that, but I’m also so concerned that I’m gonna break it because of that. So I’m extra careful.",

    "I did a lot of research before purchasing this TV and went to a couple of different big box stores to look at various brands first.  While at the store this one caught my eye for a very clear picture.  I was replacing an 8 year old 60 inch Samsung 1080p that had an OK picture but the blacks were not as deep and looked washed out and grey.  I feel that 4k is a big step up and even though the technology in TVs is really moving forward I am not sure that you really need more than 4k.  This is Samsung's entry level TV series for 2021 and I looked at several other series and didn't really notice a difference in the picture quality.  I mainly watch 4K movies via old school in a 4K player or I stream content.  I really like the Samsung TV app channel as it has plenty of free content.  Also, I use Amazon Prime for a lot of other streaming content and I don't use cable or any other service such as Netflix with this TV.  It's wall mounted in my Bedroom and 55 inch is the perfect size in my room.  Also, I use a Samsung Sound Bar so it pairs well with this TV as most TV's don't have much in the way of speakers so a sounder makes a big difference especially if you are watching a movie.  Overall, great TV at a Great Price that has a nice picture and was very easy to set up!",

    "This was my 1st Samsiung 8000 series TV.What an improvement in the picture.Sometimes I feel the people are actually right in front of me.I definitely recommend this TV to everyone!",

    "We like it, it's delivered very fast",

    "The picture  on this tv is great but the remote is terrible , The sound is only fair. The remote is hard to adjust and is not very good. The alexa they put on here is a waste of time.I will never buy this tv again.  Samsung could have done a lot better that this.  Good picture but rest is a waste.",

    "Great TV",

    "Excellent",

    "Changing the batteries the first time is a nightmare. Awful remote design. Sadistic really. Who designed the Marquis de Sade?",

    "The color on this tv is amazing!!! But that’s the only thing good about it. I couldn’t get any of the apps to download. I got the cable going but I wanted Netflix so I called Samsung for guidance. They had me on the phone for hours having me do all kinds of things, they couldn’t figure out what was going on either. After doing all the things they told me to do I lost the ability to watch cable!!! I called them back and again I was on the phone for hours for them to tell me if they sent someone out to fix it I might have to pay for repairs. Luckily Amazon stands by their Guarantee and made it very easy to return. I will never order anything made by Samsung!!!",

    "We LOVE this set! Phenomenal picture quality, easy set up, easy to learn featuresit’s great. Would definitely purchase it again.",

    "Sadly our 2020 samsung lasted exactly one year. We decided to buy this 2021 TV and it has been not even 2 months and it's even worse when watching hulu. The mouths don't match up with the words a lot. And it kicks us to the main screen way more often than the 2020 TV. We decided to get HBO max and it's the same exact thing happens. This tv is so frustrating. The positives are the clarity is really good and with our ps5 it works and looks great. Sadly I don't think we will be purchasing another Samsung TV and we have a minimum of 8 tvs in our house at all times.",

    "This is a very thin tv.  But the user interface could be better.  Its slow at times but i couldn't tell if it was the remote or the tv.  So either way its slow.  When watching dark movies.  You will see clouds of white.  This is the reason why i returned it.  If you dont care about white clouds during dark movies then this tv wont bother you.  But i believe there are better ones out there.",

    "Its only day one.Amazon service was outstanding.Recieved my television 2 days after ordering. As of day one the picture is fantastic after a few adjustments. I recommend the movie mode. But so far so good.",

    "The picture quality is good, however, the max volume isn’t high enough. I had an issue with setting up alexa, where it doesn’t recognize voice commands, I factory reset it twice and now it just doesn’t turn on the tv. I was told it’s not an option on this tv?",

    "No limitations on adding Streaming Apps, no stupid casting coupled with a killer picture and great sound. Somewhat tedious to program so have your computer, tablet of Smart Phone nearby. You'll need it. Once you add 1 or 2 Streaming apps with ICONS everything after that falls in place. We LOVE this TV and the picture for its size is second to none! SAMSUNG ROCKS!",

    "item was shipped in a timely manner and was received Item works just as advertised.",

    "Spent the little extra for this and I'm glad I did.",

    "Really good tv. Awesome picture. I wish the remote had a sleep timer button but timer can be found in the settings. Doesn’t radiate much heat.",

    "Easy to install",

    "Along the bottom of the screen there is a dark shadow. The shadow is only a few millimeters tall, but it's there, and it's very noticeable when the screen behind the shadow is a light color. When I noticed this, I ordered a replacement. The replacement has the same issue. Did some research and this is apparently just a thing with edge lit Samsung displays (going back to at least 2018). I guess I expected more from Samsung. Returned.",

    "The remote is a pain not a lot of smart options can't hook up antenna picture goes out off and on",

    "Arrived intact and on time.Picture is so very dark on some shows. Commercials are beautiful!Not a tech, so even though I have tried different configurations, still too dark.Wish I could get tv shows as bright as commercials.go figure",

    "Excellent product. Great value for the quality of TV and features. A+",

    "Easy to install and works well. I am only getting the Bixby voice assistant.",

    "One year. Burned . How convenient is samsung tic tac bomb, one day after the warranty expiration, half of the screen went black, for the technician to come is $140 to diagnose, open and fixing you will add at least more 200 to 300, minimum 400 to fix a 900 TV, do better with your money, buy a LG or sony. Samsung warranty is garbage",

    "The TV is amazing",

    "Great TV, the remote is hard to get use to, but overall it's ALOT of bang for ur buck",

    "The remote is a bit annoying.  No regrets here.  Love it",

    "good value",

    "The picture is great, smart features easy to use. The incandescent charging remote never worked. I purchased a battery operated remote separately",

    "I have a q80A upstairs and was looking for a budget tv for the basement.  The 65 inch Au8000 arrived on time. I set the TV up and went through the settings. The picture was blurry and I tried all of the system settings to fix it. Nothing worked. I was going to pissed at Samsung. Then I reset my wifi extender and connected the TV to it. Boom! The picture was perfect. There is no flickering, soap opera effect, or anything. Just a crisp ass picture. I do not game. I tried the TV on sports, news, and 4k Netflix. All was good without needing to change settings for each. I use movie mode and auto picture clarity. Max brightness and judder reduction. To be honest, I can barely tell the difference between this TV and my Q80a but I'm sure many can. Since I am not a TV connoisseur, in hindsight I should have gotten two of these. The picture is clear, the settings are easy to navigate, the remote is not primary since I mostly use the Amazon fire remote. The sound is ok. No bass at all but it suits my needs. I think for the price and my needs this was the perfect TV. For any TV used for streaming make sure you have a strong and fast internet connection.",

    "The Samsung tv is indeed a clear picture that is nice on the eyes. However from the time we plugged it in, we heard a ticking or clicking sound that never stops. All day and night it clicks. It is not a loud click, and if you have kids you may never hear it. We notice it when the tv is off and we are trying to have a little quiet time or taking a nap. Then it will seem irritating. Sounds like we are sending the second tv back. Our previous tv’s made no such sound.",

    "The interface for this TV is terrible. If you plan on using any of the smart features: voice interactions, apps, or even changing the inputs be prepare to deal with a small but notice able input lag. At first it didn't bother me but the mild inconvenience really adds up after a few months.I would recommend anyone looking for a TV that they plan on using for anything other than cable TV to find an alternative.",

    "Replace remote to be effective",

    "Samsung de 75 Crystal UHD, AU8000, 4K, UHD, HDR, Smart TV, + Alexa. EXCELENTE ARTICULOFácil de manejar. Tecnología y muy buena calidad de imagen!",

    "I was originally looking at a 43 Samsung, but this 50 went on sale for less money than the 43.I read the reviews ahead of time, and the majority of reviews said the Samsung remote that comes with it is not very good.  I took their advice and bought a universal Samsung 'do all' remote for $12, and I'm very happy I did.This tv has a great picture quality, and many settings regarding picture and sound quality you can tweak if desired. Would recommend the 8000-series Samsing!!",

    "Very user friendly to set up and to operate.",

    "Took a little while to figure it out. But all and all.  Once up and running ,  Beautiful picture yes. Would recommend...",

    "All good",

    "Red light on all night in my bedroom.  And when you turn on power the menu lights up all kinds of advertising that won't go off.  We have cable I do not need internet menu ads!  Takes several minutes to get these off the screen",

    "Muy nítido eh versátilMi uso principal ver películas y jugar",

    "I waited a bit to write this review to see how the tv work. It's been working ok. I did put a fire stick on it. It is Alexa voice enabled, but didn't have the Fire  home screen, which I prefer. I also couldn't figure out how to download a few of the apps, like Amazon music. The fire stick fixed that. After reading reviews on several different tvs, I went ahead and spent the extra money for this one. It's shipped by Amazon, arrived undamaged, has a decent picture, and sound quality. I'm satisfied.",

    "The best TV I love it came in 2 days ,work very good recommend to all",

    "Nice picture and controller. Was able to sync all my streaming services with it and throw away my old Roku.",

    "I've had a few Samsung mobile devices over the years, and I've always hated their UI... So much needless bloat. I bought this TV after having bought a cheaper brand a number of years back. The last TV didn't last very long, so I thought I would get something with a little better quality.I have a 14 year old dumb Panasonic, with a Roku stick connected, that this TV is replacing. It is only a 36 with 720P, but works great. It is being retired to a bedroom. Comparing this to my old TV is a bit disappointing. The picture quality is significantly better, and the size is definitely better for my living room. The sound is comparable to my old TV -decent. The simplified remote is better than the ones that have 20+ buttons.That's the end of the positives though. The UI/processor is experience is similar to using a 5 year old phone. It is sooooooooooo slow. After using the UI for the past 45 days. I finally just plugged in a 5 year old Roku stick into the HDMI. It is so nice to not have to push a button and then wait for something to happen.",

    "Definitely worth the price! Love it",

    "The image is washed out when sitting just a few degrees off axis. My mother asked why it's foggy, and she was sitting on a couch right in front of the TV, just sitting to the right on the couch. I am amazed they can sell this with such a poor viewing angle.",

    "Great size, easy to set up, good pixel quality. But had to fiddle with the brightness and contrast settings a lot to get it to a normal setting. Started off as way too bright ( grass looked neon yellow)",

    "Arrived broken and had to return. Bought from Best Buy and couldn’t be happier with an amazing TV",

    "I bought this for my bedroom as I didn’t want to spend a ton, it’s a nice tv for the money.  Just an fyi that there is an odd temperature deal between the heat sinks and the plastic I’m guessing, and from googling it.  I occasionally hear a thwat thwat thwat plastic sound when it’s turned off.  It seems to be going away with use.",

    "Excellent TV",

    "This is an excellent 4K starter TV, but DO NOT buy this if you want to use it for 4K gaming.  I have an Xbox One X, and after constant trial and error with the settings and various HDMI cables, a support tech from Samsung told me that this TV does not support HDMI 2.1, which is necessary for 4K gaming at 60Hz or 120Hz.  However, he said their QLED TVs are all equipped with it.  Too bad they didn't put that info anywhere in the specs for this TV.",

    "This came nicely packaged and intact. It is so very light. The remote is intuitive with button symbols. My Alexa found it and paired w/out my help. The colors and resolution are great for my tv watching, and occasional use of it as a huge computer screen. The feet are nicely far apart; I have it on a table, in the taller set up. I'd buy it again.",

    "Received it promptly through Amazon, no issues with the package or the delivery man to even offered to bring it into my home. (I declined as it was only 43 pounds). It is considerably cheaper (over $400 cheaper) than my last tv purchase with a much better quality picture. Same size screen same brand. Continue to like Samsung tv's.At least inflation hasn't reached tv's yet.",

    "I really liked the picture quality",

    "The picture quality was good for first 5 months then a line came across the picture ruining the picture. Could not send back cause it was past the return date.",

    "Very happy with this TV. Picture clear and it was easy to connect to my video recorder and to a sound bar. My wife and I love it, especially when watching sports or movies. Best purchase we've made in a long time.",

    "Tbis TV is 44 inches NOT 50 in.",

    "The default calibration on this was terrible and it was almost difficult to use as a computer monitor.  I used an x-rite/wacom color calibrator and it was vastly improved the deep blacks and light whites.",

    "First class TV",

    "We love this tv! Set up only took us about 20 mins. The remote was something to get used to but very easy to use once you play around with it. I love all the features on the tv and the picture quality is amazing. Highly recommend",

    "I got the 85 inch for myself as a holiday gift. Bought in early November. I couldnt believe the $1497 price. It also included free white glove delivery and setup which was excellent. The picture is crystal clear and bright, the remote pretty intuitive and the internal streaming channel setup really great. The apple streaming and pairing  is also easy. A great buy if it lasts. Lets hope!",

    "no audio out. cannot use wire headphones. that makes it a 3-4 for me. woulda been a 5.",

    "Good tv for the price point. Even adjusting for motion lag, choppiness can remain in live sports/etc. Frame rate just bit slow. Smart features load much slower than i expected. Replaced a 20 year old tv with a Rokuand Roku was twice as fast opening up apps/streaming content (biggest complaint). Seriously thinking about hooking the Roku into it, but seems ridiculously redundant against one of the main reasons for the purchase. Then once you have the apps open (Hulu/Netflix) scrolling is like a second delay to load programming, within the app. My 5 year old Sony (same price point) loads streaming content twice as fastpretty disappointed bc certainly wasn’t expecting the lag.",

    "We bought this to replace another Samsung tv that got the black screen of death after only two years of use. So far it’s good, it was the best we could do with our budget. Remote is better than our last tv, so much easier to use. Picture is pretty decent. Sound is okay, our last model was betterbut it’s nothing a sound-bar couldn’t make better.",

    "I have not purchased a new TV for many years. Members of my family have new ones and I was always impressed with the quality of the color and the clarity of their TVs. I finally purchased this TV expecting the same quality and clarity. I’m a little disappointed it’s not quite as good as I had anticipated. Plus the remote control is very confusing and really has a learning curve.",

    "My grand son loves it’s quality.",

    "Easy setup and a great picture.",

    "This 43” TV has never been responsive and it’s frustrating when you expect to have a smooth experience with the user experience but end up getting extremely annoyed instead because of how poor the quality is. I think Samsung cheaped out on this series because I also have a 65” and it works slightly better but still not as responsive as you would expect. Shame on you Samsung.",

    "Got the TV I needed",

    "Happy with purchase",

    "Big, clear, and bright. It’s very smart and modern. I’m pleased.",

    "The smart interface is really unintuitive to navigate. Moving apps and even seeing the box your remote is choosing can be improved",

    "ease of setup,  picture, color...great.Remote is Not user friendly.",

    "I've had this TV for 2.5 years, and after the warranty expired I've had multi problems with the set.The first is that all the apps I added some how got deleted from the set during an update. I wasn't able to add them apps back on, so it doesn't operate as a smart tv.Next the tv will no longer update new software, even if I try to do it manually.Last there is now a dark streak going down the center of the tv",

    "Definitely not recommending this tv to anyone.usually Samsung is good. I got the 65” and the picture quality is horrible.",

    "Easy to use and set up! Great picture!",

    "I love this tv",

    "Love the tv and still getting acquainted qith the features (I'm not very tech savvy).  Very easy to set up. The picture is best seen if watching head on. Side viewing is not as good but still ok. Wish the remote was backlit and had more instructions on use. Very happy with the purchase and the price.",

    "This is a wonderful TV, beautiful picture quality. Taking pictures to show off actually doesn't even do its justice, seeing it in person makes everyone want one",

    "Gran imagenDefinitivamente una gran inversión, no soy súper tecnológica, pero la imagen es buena, lo he sincronizado con Google Home y mi teléfono, además es rápido y de buen sonido.",

    "This is my first time leaving a review. We were so excited to finally receive this TV but once we turned it on this is what we saw. The screen was basically shattered from the inside.",

    "Absolutely love everything about it.",

    "Entertainment",

    "This tv is huge! The quality for the price is great. The picture is clear. We are very happy.",

    "This TV would be good if the volume would work. I have verizon Fios and every time I turn the TV on the next day the volume is off. I can’t figure out what’s going on. Sometimes I mess with it and it works but it’s annoying. I should just be able to turn it on the it works. This sucks.",

    "This TV was a pretty good price. Is it the best TV on the market, no idea.  WiFi, which I didn't want to use, works great. I wanted to cable Ethernet to my Router, but due to my house design it was just too much work. Anyway, the best part, WiFi is working just fine. ?  The Remote works great, so far, NO complaints.",

    "No recomiendo Samsung en este modeloLa compré x Amazon, los colores son Nítidos sin color  después de 30minutos,me remplazaron por el mismo modelo, y sucede lo mismo, regrese po la misma tv Samsung de 15 años de antigüedad y bella en todos sus pitzeles.  Estos nuevos modelos son una porqueria y eso que soy fanático de Samsung",

    "To watch Prime Video, Netflix etc..",

    "Remote sucks for navigating between apps and within in some cases, so much so that I just ordered a fire stick to use instead of it",

    "The picture quality is awesome and I love the features you get with Samsung, including the free Tv channels and the already included apps for the most used TV streaming apps out there. For most you wouldn't even need a streaming device because they have all the most popular apps available to you as well as the option to rent movies and TV shows and the most basic streaming TV channels. (Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Vudu and many more)The sound is better than the LG I had and the picture is crazy brilliant, doesn't hurt that it's as big as it is (I bought the 65) I love this TV and the service that was free to me at the time of purchase, was awesome making it even more worth buying it through Amazon rather than anywhere else. They came in, unpacked the TV, placed the feet on it. put it in place where I wanted it and turned it on to make sure it worked and there wasn't any damage to it. They would have set up the cable had I used cable, which was nice and as large and heavy as it was, I appreciated them doing that for me. Also, they took away the box and filler so there was no trash either. Awesome. I highly recommend this TV and recommend buying it here at Amazon as well.",

    "The sound is a bit weak, but a optically linked sound bet worked very well.",

    "My Samsung tv arrived in excellent condition. The picture is brilliant,clear, and extremely sharp. I am absolutely happy with my purchase.",

    "Excellent",

    "First review I wrote here was in error. This is a brand new, out of the box tv. It has worked wonderfully, thus far. Easy set up, great picture!  This is my third Samsung.  Each lasting over 10 years.",

    "The clarity is superb",

    "Good tv",

    "The price point, the design, the black levels. Tiny almost non existent bezels, make for a great viewing experience. The Tv feels and looks well-built.",

    "I essentially purchased adware, not a TV.This stupid thing requires so much interactivity with web/app/external computers to manage. I need a ton of subscriptions to access the content it pops on my screen, and I refuse the hundreds of dollars monthly to get them all.I just wanted a TV. Not this clumsy, stumbling app-based GUI that “does it for me” so long as I’m willing to purchase whatever it wants to fleece me for.Add to that, this weird knocking sound - almost like quiet clock ticking. Granted you have to be next to it to hear it, but god it is annoying.Worst of all, apps like the “Netflix” service can not be deleted, and is permanently affixed to my remote, even though I do not support this unethical company.I would love to return this monstrosity but I’m stuck with it now. I will never buy another Samsung.",

    "I read through many reviews before deciding on this TV. I’ll be honest I was a little concerned but this TV by far had the most promise. I was not disappointed! Picture, sound, ease of setting up apps!!!! The only “complaint” is that you cant just turn the volume down using the remote. You have to tell Alexa to do it. Remote is all black. I would love if it had some backlight in it to help. I’ll adjust!! But seriously if you’re not sure about it I can say it’s worth it.",

    "Love this TV! Great size (50) for my condo. Picture is clear, color great. The Remote is nice and small, HOWEVER, I'm still learning how to use it. The TV package came with a crib sheet for the Remote that is helpful, but the small number of buttons which do multiple tasks takes a bit to learn & get used to. The up- side is that the TV will mostly still work WITH my Spectrum Remote, so I can use that when I'm having trouble getting to the function that I'm looking for. For potential buyers ... This is my third Samsung TV, and I have never been disappointed. My 2012, 32 still works well, I just wanted to upgrade.",

    "I bought the Samsung 43 inch smart TV so that when my grandkids come over they can watch Netflix and also play Nintendo Switch. The picture is bright and clear. The colors are brilliant. So far I am happy with the TV.",

    "Unbelievably thin and lightweight. Probably the easiest set up I’ve ever had - maybe 10 mins from unboxing to watching. Picture is crisp, clear and colors are vivid. Sound isn’t bad now but will probably get a sound bar at some point. Preloaded apps and ability to download others is a boon!  Cutting the cord from cable ASAP.  Very pleased with purchase of this mid-priced smart TV.",

    "Worst TV I've ever owned. I waited too long to return it. Worst remote known to man. It disconnects from wifi for no reason. Get a ROKU",

    "I like everything about this Samsung tv",

    "Update:  with some help from a friend, got some of the issues improved.  It's still not an item I'd buy again or recommend, but I can get a reasonably clear picture to watch, and I don't watch all that much TV, so it's OK enough. Same comments hold true for the remote, though - hard to read and not intuitive.  First week: The picture is very, very dark.  Can't even see what's going on in a nighttime scene.  Also, the figures in the front of the picture are clear, but the background is all blurry.  So disappointed, plan to return it if I can't find a way to improve the picture.  Documentation not very helpful.  Remote not intuitive, hard to read.  I'd heard such great things about Samsung, but not at all impressed.  I just want to be able to watch a nice, clean picture and move around my apps without a bunch of gunk or having to study for hours.  Boo.",

    "I have never been so disappointed in a purchase. I returned this TV after only 3 days. Terrible connectivity, terrible speed, terrible controls, and graphics on par with my decade old tv. I would rather watch tv on a smartwatch than on this junk. I have a Samsung phone right now and beyond a shadow of a doubt I will be trading it out asap out of spite.",

    "I love my tv",

    "Great picture, easy set-up. Perfect for the room. Connects well to our WiFi.",

    "Horrible experience. TV arrived with dead pixels and Amazon said call Samsung..Support reset the TV thinking that would fix a dead pixel and now the smart assistant doesn't work.No one can come look at it because they don't have a technician in the area (Denver)Samsung wanted to refund the TV after picking it up 5-7 days after pickup I would get a refund and I would be able to purchase another TV.This will be the last Samsung device I ever purchase. Once known for quality is now known for trash.If you want a good TV that works out of the box, checkout LG.",

    "I was blown away by the quality of this tv!!!! The value intrigued me, but once I installed and started using the tv I was blown away. The color and quality is phenomenal!",

    "Bello mi tv",

    "Matt like Samsung TV. Make good picture. Me watch. Me like big.Yes",

    "After seeing less than spectacular 4k upscaling from the Fire TV 4 Series, Insignia F50 and Hisense U6G decided to pay the little extra for the AU8000.  My primary TV is the Samsung TU850 and was happy with it's ability to upscale from YouTube TV (something the TVs mentioned above failed at).  Amazon shipped it quickly and was able to set it up in no time using the same settings I used on my TU850.  The picture did not disappoint and was happy I made the purchase.  Then 13 days later, nothing but a black screen.  Neither remote or front button would turn it on, so back to Amazon.  Now I'm gun shy to buy another from Amazon.  Will probably go to Best Buy and pick something up as all this shipping back and waiting for my refund is getting old.",

    "Very good TV . Best thing is that Alexa can turn on/off and take care of other features for me! Color and image quality are excellent! Can’t go wrong with the price.",

    "The home screen is a little hard to use. Otherwise the TV is flawless.",

    "The tv shows very very great as you can see for your self in the video just need to connect my fire stick and I’m set",

    "Great picture easy to set up and use although it took along time to ship",

    "I suppose TV is fine as far as budget TVs go.  My issue is with Amazon.  Item’s price was reduced shortly after my purchase.  Amazon will not refund me the difference.",

    "No instructions, must click 5 times to get to picture adj.. Picture is way off from where I set it, the night before. Takes half an hour to settle back, but still refuses to become good enough not to need more playing with. Bright, all the way up, color, on 14 of 50, contrast 10 of 50. Red Green, all the way into the Green,??? Just silly.",

    "So far, so good. We got this for the voice control, which I set up through my parents' Alexa account. It's not perfect, but it's adequate for switching channels, finding some (but not all) shows/movies, and opening streaming services. You don't need to set up a Samsung account to use the TV or the voice remote.The smart remote is thankfully free of a million buttons but some basic functions can be hard to figure out, like volume and changing channels which requires an extra button press to get started.Picture quality is fantastic for a $500 TV. You don't need to screw on the supports anymore; they just slot into the bottom of the TV.",

    "Have had now about 2 weeks. Was easy to setup and program.  Picture quality has been excellent.  Soundwellas with all flat screenscould be a bit better.but it works fine for what it is.",

    "Quality of pictures, and no borders around . love this T.V.",

    "This television is the absolute best I’ve owned. It’s unfortunate that some people have difficulty connecting their television to devices. Mine has worked seamlessly.This television also has immaculate settings, clarity and color. It can automatically adjust the brightness settings when the light in the room changes. It also has a motion sensor capability, which I have yet to use. The only issue is that the speakers aren’t the greatest - you may need a sound bar!",

    "The television was damaged during shipment.  Quick and easy replacement.  Very fragile but a good quality.",

    "Bought for bed room, as we already have last year's model in living room but it isn't 4k UHD.  NOW we end up watching TV in bedroom more than anythingSize is thin and light weight picture is 'breathtaking'",

    "I spend forever reading reviews on all these different kinds of TV's.  Samsung made a pretty amazing TV!  So many awesome features that were super easy to set up!  I LOVE this TV! Totally recommend!!",

    "Suggest a sound at but setup is difficult",

    "The smart remote is really good plus the TV quality is amazing.I'm thinking of getting another one for my bedroom.",

    "This tv is better picture then my 85” QLED tv that cost me 3x more then this on. Delivery guys were awesome ! Too.",

    "After just 6mo of use its getting a dark spot on the lower left side of TV very disappointing  😞",

    "Read about this after it started happening to my TV. Seems temperature related.",

    "Relying on the best reputation in the TV industry, Samsung is faltering in its attention to quality.  Long-time Samsung loyalists, my family purchased four Samsung TVs in the past six years.  (Two went bad.)  I suspect they're leaning too much on brand reputation and are now producing lesser products.  I'm reviewing the budget lineup.  Reviewers don't spend much time looking at the entry-level budget TVs in comparison to other brands; they tend to review premium TVs where Samsung shines.  In the budget lineup, however, i can't say much good.We just bought the 2021 AU8000.  Unfortunately, the AU8000's picture doesn't live up to our high expectations of a Samsung TV and I'm disappointed we bought it.  We bought this to replace a 6900 series TV purchased in 2019, which already died.  By comparison to the 6 series television, the AU8000's screen looks washed out no matter how much we adjust the picture settings.  (There's nothing wrong with it.  It's just not as good-- especially viewing at a slight angle.  Compare in the store before you buy.)  Even the motion is jerkier.  (We always turn off the judder control, because it makes everything look like an unnatural soap opera.  What I'm comparing is worse judder on the new TV given the same settings.)The good of the AU8000: The voice remote is cool, and the menus are faster than previous TVs.  Plus, the excellent Smart TV features on a Samsung TV as well as the TV Plus channels are a big selling point.  Not having any number buttons on the remote, however, takes some getting used to.Overall, unfortunately, it's disappointing.  We should have switched brands, and here's a run-down of why.  You might consider another quality brand, as I wish we had.1) We bought a Samsung series 5 TV in late 2015.  In 2019, it had an LED problem with light to moderate use, producing a super-bright spot with a halo; so, we replaced it with a Samsung 6 series TV.  (We got four good years out of the Series 5, so we didn't complain and still use it in a bedroom.)2) The 6 Series TV had a problem with the mainboard/power supply board within the warranty period.  The TV wouldn't even power on.  Instead of replacing the TV, Samsung sent a technician to our house to replace the mainboard.  It worked for another 17 months, and then the new mainboard died.  We got less than 2-and-a-half years out of this TV.  This was infuriating, as we're budget-conscious consumers expecting at least 5 years of use.3)  Confident in Samsung TVs, nonetheless, we replaced the 6 series TV with an AU8000.  The problem: This TV has a noticeably inferior, washed-out picture quality than the 5 or 6 series TVs.  (All 3 are budget-conscious LED TVs.)  Unboxed, my family doesn't want to go through the hassle of returning it because it's good enough.  For good enough, though, we could have saved $100 by buying an LG.To Samsung's credit, we bought a 7 series as well for light use in a downstairs room, and it's reasonably good with a clean picture.  Recently, however, its Smart TV features have been slowing down and lagging significantly for no apparent reason.  It's just really slow now.I write this review to warn buyers: Samsung isn't necessarily the best anymore.  Yes, they get the good reviews.  Yes, technicians like them for their quality parts.  Yes, despite my problems they're still excellent TVs with a solid track record.  But: in today's market, there are many good TVs.  I wish we had considered a Sony, an LG, or a Visio.  Samsung simply has grown too big and our experience-- with recent generations of Samsung TVs-- has not been excellent.  If it had just been one TV with problems, that would be one thing.  We've had problems with several now.An interesting note: I could have fixed the 6900 TV myself if the mainboard were available anywhere.  It's not.  Every single source from Ebay to Amazon to a dozen+ other TV parts sites are out of stock.It's time to consider other excellent options.",

    "Horrible picture quality, horrible customer service, and horrible device functionality. Thought I’d save some money and buy a Samsung rather than my usual Sony. Obviously a mistake. Returning this asap and replacing with Sony!",

    "This TV is awesome! The picture quality and sound are great. Only thing they could change is the remote control. Otherwise love it!",

    "Bought the 85” and was super excited. Had the full delivery and setup and never mounted. The smart features are horrible, unresponsive, tv won’t turn off for 15-20 minutes or turn back on. Super slow, tons of adds. If you think it can’t get worse than the smart tv features you’re wrong.  Tons of white light comes through the screen, black scenes has burnout, flash lighting, lines, and boxes. The picture was worse than my old 1080p tv. Samsung support was useless. Amazon was great and is getting it returned. Don’t even want to exchange it. Can’t get rid of it fast enough.",

    "Fits perfectly over our Fireplace",

    "Talking is super quiet on anything we watch and other sounds (like a door closing or a gunshot) are actually amplified.The days of quality products, built by intelligent folks, are over.",

    "Tiny bezel and understated Samsung logo. Great picture with deep, deep blacks. It may not be OLED and all that, but I'm definitely pleased.The articulating mount pictured (Mounting Dream Full Motion TV... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0882QSKR5?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) supports the TV well.",

    "Good, the remote is easy to use compared to reviews i have read about it. I am loving my TV.",

    "Great TV for the price. We needed a TV in our sun room, which we use as a secondary family room. It was a three way tie between this or the Samsung 86inch 120hz, or Samsung 85 inch base model Qled. We chose this one since its a room where we don’t use the TV every day, it was worth saving the the $300 dollars extra had we purchased one of the other two. Although, I would have liked the 9000 series for the 120hz but again , would rather save the $300 since the viewing experience is still awesome.",

    "(Because some people don't read all the way though long reviews, I'm editing my original review of the 43 Samsung AU8000 that I ordered from Amazon. Please read the manual!)For a quick bottom line, the picture can be superb. The Handmaiden, a superb S. Korean thriller that's  in 4K Ultra HD - had superb color and clarity after the settings were adjusted. (more later)Initially, while I got good to excellent images on broadcast streaming news channels (ABC, CBS and NBC), some Amazon Prime movies lacked sufficient brightness in dark scenes, regardless of Brightness and Contrast settings. (Goliath was particularly dark.) The Samsung rep I contacted suggested using the Dynamic setting. However, this isn't an accurate setting in test reports, and while brighter than the other modes, actually produces less detail than Filmmaker or Movie mode. And on my Samsung sample,  there was some backlighting bleed, particularly in corners, with brightness turned to the max. setting.Under Picture/Expert Settings, I had the best results not by turning up Brightness and Clarity to the maximum settings (I keep both between 25 and 35, and sometimes bump Color up from 25 to 30-35; Sharpness remains at 0), but by making adjustments to: Gamma, and Shadow Detail. (Gamma adjusts the mid-range brightness of the picture, and Shadow Detail adjusts the brightness of dark images.) I experimented with each one separately, and in combination with the other. Voila! Moving each from 0 to 1 or 2, depending on the movie or program (Gamma has 3 settings when watching UHD/HDR; Shadow Detail has five) allowed me to see the images in dark scenes of Goliath and Bosch much more clearly. Again, this was with the Brightness control set in a more moderate range of 25-35, rather than at the maximum of 50. That meant there was less back lighting bleeding through on dark fields, and it increases the life of the TV. On regular programming, this isn't necessary; the TV was bright enough with all the settings at the mid-point, and with the picture set on Movie mode, which seems to give the most accurate image, while preserving detail. (Filmmaker mode was a bit darker.)I gave the TV a rating of 4, but on some programming, I'd give it a 4 1/2...possibly even a 5. (The Handmaiden detail and color were fantastic!) For the price, the AU8000, when adjusted properly, is a good deal..an excellent deal, in fact. Everything has worked as expected, though I've admittedly had it set up for just a month. As I add apps for streaming services, and maybe an antenna for local programming, I think I'll enjoy it even more. Highly recommended, but read the manual, and experiment with the settings.",

    "First, the stand we have that worked just fine for my last Samsung is too problematic for me to deal with so I would have to hire someone.  The sound isn't great at all, tinny sounding.If you're not looking full on at it the colors are just really weird!I HATE the way their sleep timer is set up.  You can't set it while you're watching something, you have to do exit out, and then hunt for the settings, then go through 15 steps to finally get to setting a timer--just what you want to do when you're ready to settle down to go to sleep.  NOT COOL.Live shows are a nightmare.  The sound and video won't sync properly--watching it looks like the sound and the video are connected at all.  Very distracting and annoying.This is SOOOOOOOO inferior to the one I was replacing, which I still have and put in another room.Big mistake!",

    "I dislike the fact that I bought a TV that did not work. Maybe it was damaged in transporting it to me. I really trust the SAMSUNG name.",

    "Apps are slow. I do not like this T.V. Going to purchase another Vizio.",

    "Love the quality and price...even comes with free Samsung plus internet channels...great buy.",

    "I could but I don't want to",

    "This TV worked great for the first 3 months and not even 4 moths of using it lightly the screen got all distorted.. not worth your money.. go to an actual store where you get a protection plan and save yourself $600..So disappointing...",

    "Exceeds my expectations",

    "I don't have  to wear glasses! Thanks for arriving before eta.",

    "After waiting 2 weeks I finally received the TV which the box delivered was in good condition and apparently the TV too, however when I took it out of the box I noticed a small stain on the upper right side.  I immediately realized that something was not right and indeed when I turned it on it was faulty.  Very disappointed, I had been waiting for this one.  I wanted them to replace it but they only gave me the option to return it and the refund of the money to my card, which I hope I will not have problems with that.",

    "This is a great TV. It was easy to setup and the picture is incredible. My only complaint is with the sound, the speakers are small and dialog  is sometimes difficult to understand (a common problem with flat screens) I'll be getting a sound bar soon which I'm sure will fix the problem. Overall though, it's a great TV with a picture that is almost lifelike.",

    "The TV could not connect to the Wifi and the remote control did not work. It took a repair man to replace a few parts of the brand new TV to get everything to work. This is simply not acceptable. Worst of all, we only found out that the features didn't work until the TV had been hoisted to above the fireplace. It was not a happy purchase experience.",

    "Picture quality is great.  Set up was a bit of work but not too bad.  So far we are pleased.  Just got it today though.",

    "Needed a TV for the bedroom. For the price you have really good standard 4K UHD picture quality. The remote is made a lot simpler than the typical TV remote. Reminds me of the Amazon Firestick remote but longer. And being a smart TV you can access all the apps and subscriptions you have on there. Great buy!",

    "Love that it’s light.  Don’t love picture quality",

    "i registered the Samsung Smart TV- please disregard my previous review -",

    "Nice size Great picture",

    "You can’t switch ads off. I don’t know what else it is capable of but it’s a pretty bad feature. Enough to warrant a 1-star",

    "Just received this TV today. We were so excited to set it up. There was no visible damage, so you can imagine our surprise and dismay to see some very noticeable display issues. There is a bright white line that runs across the bottom of our screen. It’s extremely noticeable and very distracting. Called and spoke to Samsung support and walked through every troubleshooting step, including display and picture setting and factory reset. The next step is for us to have an engineer come out and assess, but based on the conversation I had with the technician it sounds like the TV will probably have to be completely replaced. So far this has been an awful experience, especially for a TV that came at such a high price tag. Super unhappy with my purchase, thank goodness this horrible TV is under warranty. Hopefully the replacement does not have the same issue this one does, otherwise we’ll have to return for a refund. I would not recommend this TV.",

    "Picture quality.",

    "What a huge waste of money. When this crappy product actually comes to life, it will usually only tune in channel 6, regardless of what channel you input into the remote control. Most of the time, it tells me my internet is not functioning properly. Funny, every other device in the house can connect with the internet with no issues whatsoever. Do yourself a favor, and buy a different brand, because Samsung is crap.",

    "There are so many apps built into this thing and its not possible to remove most of them (guessing they get paid to include). Its extremely difficult to set up a simple antenna (for local sports) because they are pushing Samsung TV so hard. Everything is tracked. Multilple privacy acknowledgements required. Makes me long for a 32” old school TV. Once again, WE, the consumers, are truly the product and all our info is being sold. I will not buy another Samsung, maybe everything else is the same, I’ll risk it just like trying out a new barber",

    "When there is a lot of action the screen blurs and can’t keep up.  My previous flat screen was almost 10 years old and had a better picture than this one.  Also the TV makes a knocking noise when turned off. Very annoying.  Just not impressed",

    "Bought as a replacement TV for our game room.  Picture is crystal clear and the remote makes it easy to  operate.  However with Directtv Genie you must use the Genie remote.",

    "Don’t buy. This tv makes a loud clicking noise whether on or off.  I haven’t had any luck with Samsung repair.",

    "Just perfect",

    "Amazing tv, we are really happy!",

    "Crystal clear screen",

    "Over the years we've had several Samsung TVs and mostly we've been happy with them. This one is the first time I've tried to deal with Samsung's support services. Initially they were straight foreword and helpful. After two months trying to deal with the defects, I was transferred to their Case Management Department to return the TV and obtain a refund. That is when the process came to a halt. After two weeks of waiting to for an email so I could approve their Terms and Conditions, I started making numerous calls trying to expedite the process. To date, I'm still waiting. Placed on hold every time waiting to talk to someone. This is the last time I'm buying anything with Samsung on it. I recommend you do the same.",

    "This TV has easy to use on screen features with excellent picture quality.  Set up was simple to complete.  Very good buy for the money .  Only negatives are hard to use remote and poor speaker system using TV speakers.  Maybe a sound bar is required to get better audio.",

    "The speakers are really cheap and sounds so low even at max volue. My older Samsung that was 200 less looks just as good with the benefit that thw speakers also sound alot better.",

    "This is a day 1, just set it up review  in the event anything happens to change my first impressions, I will edit this. So far, I love everything about this tv. From the well packaged way it was shipped to me  to the ease (and I mean easy) set up  to the outstanding picture quality  this tv - thus far - is a winner.  To address a couple of negative reviews I’ve read here  the sound quality from this tv is outstanding (it’s not sound bar or amp system quality, but it’s absolutely fine and ranks among the best native tv sound I’ve heard). The tv remote is just fine. It’s not a Nikon camera   it’s a tv remote .. and I love how Samsung minimized - to the max - the amount of buttons on it  THANK YOU!  No screws in the box either  the legs (if you’re not mounting with VESA) just slide into the frame  THANK YOU Samsung again   and - for me - no Roku or Firestick necessary  all of my paid streaming services showed up (of course you have to enter user names and passwords .. just once) and stream great right through the tv’s native wireless just fine .. love that too!  I agonize over purchases like this .. and often vacillate   but today it seems I’ve made a great choice.Update 12/7/21:  Although I did report that my streaming services all streamed fine through the TV’s built-in wireless (and they do), the interface/navigation through Home Screen for finding and selecting content .. then opening and starting shows is somewhat sluggish  am talking waiting several seconds here, not minutes.  Still, I bit the bullet and purchased and connected a new Firestick 4K Max (currently on sale for $34.99) which speeds things up considerably.  Again, a Firestick or Roku device is not required to run your streaming content .. but you might want to get one to speed things up.",

    "43 inchLike:- Easy set up of cable box, Firestick, and apps- Size is just right for my primary viewing distance (10 feet away) and room (15' x 20')- Audio and Video are great out of the box - of course, the audiophiles out there have much better equipment - but out of the box, the sound is a big improvement from my last Samsung TV.Dislike:- It is difficult to do PC to TV screen casting wirelessly - although both the PC and the TV are on the same network subnet and the PC can see the TV, it is still not working.  Continuing down this rabbit hole until I figure it out.- The remote is only OK - functional.  Great to navigate the smart TV, but not the cable box...so I need to use 2 remotes.  Would prefer just one.- The Samsung Smart TV menu is not my favorite - not as easy, imo, to Firestick - it is difficult to modify certain settings such as the menu bar, which is front and center.  It is not intuitive to me.",

    "Bought this Samsung TV AU8000 model expecting an easy, seamless connection to my Gigabit speed wireless connection. Very disappointed with this product. After spending hours between speaking with a Samsung agent, my internet service provider (Xfinity), and updating the software/hard factory reset/etc, the final verdict was they shipped the TV with a defective wireless card. I have owned Samsung TVs in the past and was able to connect easily to my home network. Samsung needs to improve the quality control of their products.",

    "Perfect for our little room and very easy to set up",

    "Beautiful picture.Remote is cheap and annoying.",

    "Love this TV. Great picture and fabulous contrasts. I feel like I’m in the stadium while watching a NFL game",

    "So far, everything is fine. The previous TV in my house is also a Samsung brand. It is better to buy a TV from Samsung!",

    "I purchased a Samsung TV in Aug 2021 and it went bad in Oct of 2021.  It is now the first of Dec 2021 and Samsung still has not fixed or replaced it.  4 on-line chats, 6 phone calls and two techs worked on the TV but can't fix it.  Every phone call we need to escalate this up to lever 2 and someone will contact you in 24-48 hours.  Well, it has been a month and no one has called.  I will never buy another Samsung TV and long as I live.  Everything in my house is a Samsung but never again.  I don't even want that world mentioned in my house ever.",

    "Once unpacked and placed on my tv stand, had the tv all set up with regards to picture, sound and remote.Had prime video and Netflix all configured and running.Very happy with this television.",

    "Love the tv, but the speakers suck. Get a sound bar right away.",

    "This TV has some MAJOR issues!  The menus are terrible, it is a pain to set up, and worst of all, the computing chip they use is too slow for the applications they are running.  So there is a 1-second delay from when you press a button on the controller, and something happens on the screen.  At first, I thought I could get used to it, but It is driving me CRAZY!  It takes way too long to simply enter your email and password for any apps.  It takes easily three times as long to get to what you want to watch compared to the slowest ROKU I have ever tried.Ever tried to use a 15-year-old computer with modern software?  That is what it feels like to use this TV.  I can't believe they are selling this thing.  The smart components basically ruined this TV.  Save yourself a lot of time and frustration and simply avoid this piece of junk.",

    "This tv has a good picture, but that’s about all that I like about it. I gave it one star because it wouldn’t let me leave it at no stars. It randomly goes back to the Home Screen mid show, usually right at the part you want to see. I would honestly rather blow it up with Tannerite than get my money back just for the joy of it.",

    "save yourself all the headaches. don't waste your money on this crap TV.  it's torture unlimited.you've been warned.  i will NEVER BUY A SAMSUNG  PRODUCT AGAIN. EVER.it is SO bad it is not worth the time to make the huge list of what doesn't work....samsungs answer for any problem is to factory reset the thing and that still never solves any problem.....then you have to re-do all your info to even use the thing again.  i wasted 500$ on this thing and I need therapy to get over my rage about it.",

    "Remote is horrible never works!!!!!",

    "Nothing extraordinary.  Dead pixel. Delivery/installation guys put the tv face down on the box where it came from and which was sagging in the middle. The tv was laying bent the whole time they put the stand and power cable.  So I'm just waiting for something unsatisfying to happen in the coming days.",

    "I wanted so bad to keep this TV because the value for the $ is good. The panel has great contrast and color very smooth, beautiful UHD playback. Other reviewers here have stated that drip, drip is what you hear from inside the tv while it is off.  I was searching for a leak in my wall before realizing it was coming from the TV.  I returned the unit for another and the new one makes, albeit much quieter than the drip, a squelching sound coming from where the power plug inserts into the back of the TV. It's really sad how widespread this issue is as 55 owners have had it too.  It's pretty clear this year's models were not quality controlled so back to the drawing board for looking for a good 50.",

    "Real great TV the picture is amazing and simple to use",

    "The Item arrived damages though I did not see the kind of damage to the box that would have explained the shattered screen.  However Amazon could not provide a replacement so I had to get a refund and return the 73lb tv to UPS myself.  I bought an identical model from Best Buy for $100 less since all my installation prep relied on this model of TV.",

    "Having difficulty programming for basic cable at my mother's assisted living facility.  We have tried several times.  If we wanted wi-fi connection, we could do that.  She wants and understands basic cable from Suddenlink, which is provided by the facility. The tv doesn't recognize cable channels.",

    "It's hard to believe how bad the picture quality in this Tv actually is. Darks so dim that you can barely see the shadows. Brights too washed out. Just a terrible waste of money. Don't believe the reviews. Just a terrible picture over all.",

    "Just got this yesterday and I'm wondering if I need to adjust a dew setting because my picture quality is off picture isn't clear at all. Help would be great",

    "very good tv . clear picture quality fast wifi connection with 5g . I love it",

    "You would think bc of the brand it would be a great buy at the price they had it for (around $800) it would be a steal.  Don't.  Just go to best buy or a more reputable electronics seller.  Amazon got the bottom of the barrel with all the issues that comes along with it.  Picture stays pixelated even with direct ethernet connection and we have the highest speed with Verizon Fios. The remote is the worst, the smallest tap and it's changing applications or turning off completely.  The usability is terrible compared to other TVs even those considered to be lesser brands.  It doesn't search across all apps when you search for a program or movie you want to watch.  You cannot download every app either, like our other smart TV does (Toshiba Fire TV).  All in all I'd return it if I could but I waited too long.",

    "We had a 75 and many other sizes, but this is a Must-have dream come true. 85 cinematic experience, beautiful image, you TALK to the remote and the response is accurate. It's Awesome",

    "While I wish it had a few things, it’s a great tv. The sound and picture are fantastic.",

    "Home entertainment",

    "It is irritating to be forced to keep and search through unwanted apps every time you use the TV.  At least on my phone or on my other Samsung TVs the apps could be moved out of the way if not deleted.  More than1/2 of the memory is used by over a dozen preloaded apps that can not be deleted. Be careful children or non tech savvy persons may accidentally subscribe to services you don't want.",

    "Great tv. Easy setup. Beautiful picture. Great value.",

    "A few years ago I switched exclusively to samsung TVs. This TV has likely ended that going forward, and unfortunately despite being a former Samsung fan I can no longer recommend samsung TVs to friends and family..The main reason for my poor review is the smart system on this TV, compared to my other current,  and previous Samsung TVs, this one freezes incessantly! so much so that it is a regular hindrance when trying to use the device. Just navigating menus without even going into any apps, just browsing the TVs menus can be a nightmare of lagging, frozen screens, and unresponsive button pushes. Features like the built in microphone, something I use regularly on my other samsung TVs for searches and commands, have not worked a single time on this TV,  not once!  I don't know why that button is even on the remote or that feature advertised, because it does not work at all.. I beleive a big part of the problem may be that samsung has elected to add too much bloatware & advertising to the tizen software on this TV causing the hardware to become overwhelmed or short of memory rendering it useless. I'm speculating, but whatever the case may be, it isn't just a bit slow, it is so frequently freezing up, or ridden with features like the voice function not working entirely that it shouldn't be on the market, because it does more damage to the brand's reputation than it's worth in my opinion.. that said asside from those issues, and perhaps they could be fixed with a software update, for the price range this is in,  it has a decent picture quality with my only complaint being blacks being a bit blown out and more dark gray, this cuts away from good HDR,  but the colors look great and the picture is good otherwise.. that is if you get to the point of actually watching something without giving up trying after frustratingly trying to get through the freezing, laggy smart system to get to your content.I Likely would've given it 4 or 5 stars if it wasn't for the smart system, but it is so bad as is that it is a deal breaker.",

    "This 4K tv somehow seems less sharp than my Sony 65”. At the same distance. After researching, the 43” Samsung’s use something called the BGR with dithering. Makes things like gaming and text seem off with a strange crosshatch pattern giving me headaches.Avoid all Samsung 43 TVs if you want to use it for gaming or a pc monitor. You will run into clarity issues from what true 4K should look like. Looks like 1080p or less. Wish I knew how strong of an impact it the clarity was before ordering.Side note. Awesome remote. Works anywhere pointed anywhere.",

    "good color",

    "it's picture perfect!",

    "Its very nice thin and looks gorgeous, wacthing movies are simply exceptional",

    "Nice tv good pic quality well worth the price",

    "This a very good tv.Good smart features and great picture quality.",

    "This TV is an excellent value.  The picture is perfect to me and the smart features all work well.  My only issue with the remote is the odd volume control.  Just takes getting used to.  It would not stop me from buying it if I needed another",

    "This TV has great picture and size! Awesome buy!",

    "it is hard to use remote",

    "The picture quality is wonderful. I'm extremely happy with my purchase",

    "Arrived on time.  Original Samsung box had small dent in corner, but didn't puncture box.  Instantly on plugging in I noticed the screen picture was broken in upper left corner. Disappointing, because the picture itself is great, far better than I expected at this price point.  I question the wisdom of shipping large heavy TVs by carriers like UPS. I returned the item and will repurchase at a local store rather than taking my chances with another carrier during the holiday season.  Amazon was great, as always, with the return.",

    "remote is to basic doesn't pair well with cable box",

    "Buen precio y muy bonita teleEsta grande para mi pared se ve muy bonita la recomiendo mucho de muy buena calidad",

    "New television sets need to come with better instructions of how to set up and operate them.  I have spent all weekend trying to learn how to use the remote.",

    "Alexa does not turn on TV.",

    "Love the sharpness of pictures. Size is great and most of all my husband really likes it all",

    "Easy to set up. Love it. Never thought I would own a tv this big. So happy!!",

    "We just bought this new budget-friendly Samsung LED 4K UHD TV from one of our local outlet stores (the model is the same as the one Amazon sells and the price is also identical). We used a wall mount  to place the TV on the wall in our kitchen. The TV is very thin (about 1' altogether and the top bezel is only about half an inch or so). If you plan mounting the TV on a wall, it uses a standard VESA 200 x 200 mm. wall mount and you need 4 M8 x 1.25 screws - Samsung says to use 11-13 mm. ones but I only could find 16mm. ones in our local hardware store, which, after putting a thin washer on each screw to make the screws slightly shorter, worked perfectly.Compatibility with external devices appears to be very good - we use Roku on all our Samsung TVs and putting a Roku 4K streaming stick was very easy. The TV was very fast to update its software and we could enjoy streaming a 4K UHD HDR movie in no time!But - be warned, the sound on this TV is probably the worst I heard from a Samsung TV. It is hollow and even somewhat muddy. We were able to pair easily through Bluetooth the TV with a mini Hi-Fi system and, thankfully, there is no lag between the sound and the picture. But, if you plan to use the TV without an external speaker or a soundbar - its own sound is very subpar!All in all, the picture is extremely good - vivid, bright colors and excellent 4K detail. The remote, on the other hand, is very thin and this may not necessarily be a plus. Since we bought from Amazon last fall a TU-8000 model for one of our bedrooms, it came with Ambient Mode. The AU-8000, however, has no Ambient Mode, contrary to what some websites list about this model. So, if you want the TV to blend with your room décor - this model won't do.Also - you'll probably want to opt out of the annoying ads when you do the initial setup of the TV, so do not accept the Interest-Based Advertisement Service.The price is quite good at the time of writing this (just before Black Friday), so the TV definitely delivers where it matters most - in terms of picture and functionality. Its sound quality is a big minus, though, and you'll definitely want to pair it to an external speaker.",

    "The sound isn’t very loud, even with the Samsung Sound Bar. Not worth the price",

    "The unit came in without remote",

    "Installation and setup were straightforward since I was already using an Amazon Fire TV Stick on my 32in Samsung TV. I Installed an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K MAX which loaded the same configuration already existing on my 32in Samsung TV. Reaching the SOURCE screen is more difficult with the AU8000 than it was with my M4500 32in Samsung TV. Unlike the M4500 remote, there is no SOURCE button on the AU8000 remote. I have not tried interfacing any bluetooth devices yet. Picture quality and sound on my AU8000 are good.",

    "This is easily the nicest tv I’ve ever owned and the nicest tv between everyone I know. It’s great for gaming, movies, football and I actually like the remote, some people in the reviews hate idk why. Overall an outstanding tv especially considering the price. I’m still struggling to figure out why it’s so cheap. 100% worth the purchase. I will say, it’s very heavy, and very fragile so be extremely careful with it when moving it to its permanent place. 2 people is doable but sketchy, 3-4 is best",

    "great picture and easy to set up.",

    "I purchased this TV and it was delivered on October 31, 2021.  Sixteen days later, while moving the TV a couple of inches, I heard a crunch sound along where I was holding the plastic edging of the TV.  I then went to turn it on and nothing on the screen except 6-8 inch spider cracks on the screen and no picture or sound.  I have tried to call, text, chat with Samsung and they refuse to offer any solution other than to refer me to a repair company who said it will cost me $700+ to repair the screen.  The TV cost approximately $750.  For all intense and purposes, it now is a $700+ piece of garbage.  I am extremely upset and disappointed with Samsung, and for that matter, Amazon who will have nothing to do with the TV.",

    "Calidad en un producto.Tiene el tamaño ideal, con una imagen nítida, su sonido es impecable y es bello.",

    "This TV is perfect , the size ( 65”) , the picture,  even the remote is pretty and easy to control . I got this tv on a Sunday morning and within 30 minutes I was ready with the set up . Very easy with directions and self exploratory. And I like that is so thin. The sound is perfect , I don’t need a sound box at all .",

    "Very crisp clear picture, sound is good, very happy with purchase.",

    "Could not get Fubo",

    "Perfecto",

    "Wow! I bought a Sony Bravia same size more expensive. The picture on the Samsung is 10 fold better than the Sony. Ice been a long time Sony fan since the 80s.",

    "It doesn’t connect to Alexa and has daily sound issues when changing inputs",

    "The directions SINK..  Couldn't figure out on to put on feet to hold up TV. Hope we got them right. The directions for the remote control also SINK. Had to call Samsung to get TV to work. Going online to see if I can get better manual.",

    "When I decided to invest in a smart tv wasnt sure which brand to go with. So decided to go with Samsungbecause I trust their products. And please with my decision the picture is crystal clear and works beautifully with my laptop.",

    "It had one amazing picture !!!! Super easy to set up for a non-tech savvy 38yr old person. Lol I just wish it came with a Samsung Dolby soundbar !!",

    "This television was not worth the price.  The picture is not any better than another picture and the remote did not control the volume.  I don't know you all but I do not always want to use the mic to turn the volume up, especially when you have to continually repeat yourself to get it at the volume you want.  Not worth the money!!!",

    "First class",

    "Enjoy the 5 second wait time between clicks and the minute wait for the wireless card to turn on :)",

    "Great tv for the price can’t go wrong!!!!",

    "This TV is awesome ! it is a great TV for the price I would recommend this size and this TV to anyone-",

    "Loved my old Samsung tv so much I bought another one. This one came with almost 300 Samsung tv channels.. I am a cord cutter so this is a bonus..Thank goodness the old remote also works on new TV because I am not a fan of the new remote.",

    "AirPlay (for Apple) and Windows screen sharing does NOT work.  I use both on other Samsung TV's just fine and know what I am doing, but it just will not show itself to another device.  I see there are other comments about that as well.  Wish I would have read them all before buying.",

    "Great picture",

    "Let me begin this review by stating that we have had many Samsung TV’s in the past, and have been very happy. This purchase is an exception. I purchased this TV as a Christmas present. Bad idea when you are not covered by the extended return. My husband was in the hospital, and I wanted to have it when he got home. The TV arrived. He didn’t feel well enough to put it up right away, so it sat for several weeks. By the time that he felt well enough to install it, turn it on, and watch it, it lasted 2 weeks total! First, there was a line in the picture, and within 2 days, the entire picture went black. We are beyond the return period, so we are left to customer service, and repair. It might just be our last Samsung. Beware.",

    "I've had this television for 10 days and so far so good. I don't particularly like the remote. I don't mind that it's small but that it's so delicate. If you bump or touch it, it sends you back to the Samsung channel. I had to learn to pick it up from the bottom and put it where it won't get jostled or otherwise touched when I am watching a program.However, the picture is beautiful, clear and precise.",

    "I love the picture and other features.  I hate the remote, so I spent $10 for the Samsung-TV-Remote All Samsung LCD LED HDTV 3D Smart TVs by Angrox.  Best $10 I ever spent!  It makes the Smart TV experience, access to apps, and volume control so much better.  The only thing I salvaged from the original remote is the two free AAA batteries.",

    "The delivery was flawless. I asked if they could put in the house and they did not hesitate, they were very friendly and professional.  As for the T.V. make sure you have your phone or computer ready to start set up. It took about 15 minutes to get everything ready to go, it runs through a setup of each of the features and the apps. Such vivid colors and the picture quality is excellent.  You get so many channels that you can access for free. We could not be more pleased.",

    "So to begin with the price for this TV is a Lil to pricey for what you get. I bought this just to have any TV wasn't looking for the best of the best but for 500 dollars I think the resolution could have been better whenbi play my switch it's a Lil pixely. And had a older TV before and didn't have that problem my opinion the TV should have been no more than 300 just a warning to the buyers out there if your looking for a good gaming TV I would look elsewhere",

    "Beautiful picture nice sound easy to set up we use it outside by the fire table",

    "Great picture quality for the price",

    "Amazon was very obliging in facilitating the return. While the picture was very bright when tuned to live TV, on streaming Netflix and Prime Video the picture was too dark to see all details. We had to turn the volume up to the max (100) to hear it well, which made me feel crowded for flexibility with the volume. All in all, it didn't work out well for us and we're happier with our LG replacement.",

    "Remote control is not user friendly !!!",

    "Look use and smaller",

    "I was worried about making this kind of purchase on Amazon.  It’s an expensive item that can break easily and you’re not sure what quality you’re getting.  However, it was delivered in promptly in perfect condition.I had not planned on using the smart features because I’ve had negative experiences with them on other TVs.  Usually they’re slow, glitchy, or just don’t work.  The features on this TV work like a dream and the 4K is great.  It definitely exceeded my expectations and I will be buying Samsung in the future",

    "Tv is nice since it is larger than my old tv but picture quality isn't that much better for the money I paid for it. The remote isn't bad but I think the firestick remote is better. I use my firestick to get programing cause I think it is better and I don't have to get another account to set up with Samsung. I guess overall I'll keep the Samsung cause I can read the print better on channels since it is a larger tv, can't help but think I should have gone for another Sony. Just hope this Samsung  holds up as well.",

    "I bought this TV February 2020 it is already broken.  There are zero repair people around me, so Samsung cannot and will not fix it. They told me to find local sources local sources told me TVs break so often that it be more beneficial for me to buy a new one.  I don’t know about you but I don’t have $700 to drop every year for a new TV. It is an absolute shame because this TV came so highly recommended look at Sony or get a really good warranty.",

    "This is an awesome tv and we couldn't be happier. Literally had it removed from the box, plugged in two cords, and we were in business!! The two gentlemen that delivered our tv were fantastic. Very personal, friendly, and efficient. I really wish I got their names to give a better compliment, but I was too excited about my new tv they had set up in record time. Would buy ten more with delivery if I could afford it!! 😁",

    "Love this TV.  Got the 65 inch for 650 at Costco. I live in Montana so no sales tax.  650 exactly.. great score",

    "This TV and sound bar w/woofers absolutely perfect.",

    "We Got A 75” For Our Living Room But I Wanted A TV For The Bedroom Too. I Like Big TVs But Something Bigger Than A 50” Would Be Too Much For A Bedroom. This Was Perfect And Exactly What I Was Looking For. Once Again Samsung Didn’t Disappoint.",

    "The sound went out and beyond my return date! I bought it in August 2021!",

    "this tv is outstanding. the color and sound are perfect. it is a bit dificult to switch from my cable provider, but i have gotten the hang of it and now i have every cable provider available.",

    "don’t bother getting this unless you have a sound bar, because the native speakers are low quality. They routinely scratch and cut out whenever the audio falls outside some acceptable range. Very disappointing for such an expensive product",

    "Replaced a Plasma circa 2009 and was pleased with the quality of the picture.  The Smart Features are convenient and easy to use.  Product design well worth the price and value delivered.",

    "Amazon should be praised for delivering this heavy and fragile product efficiently and intact! Very happy customers!",

    "Good picture. Good wifi. Good value for a small room (11 x 11)",

    "Audio sucks",

    "Luego de una semana de uso el tv no sirvió,  quedo en patrón de colores o modo refreshLuego de pocos días de haber sido usado el tv fallo al encenderlo,  la pantalla solo hacía cambios de colores , lamentablemente lo envié fuera de Estados Unidos y no gozo de garantía.",

    "My tv came yesterday and I set it up this morning.  First thing I noticed is that it was very difficult to connect my cable coax cable.  The connector on the back is so close to the back of the tv, my old cable would not screw on. So I ended up spending money to buy a new cable. We had to turn the tv on its side and use a wench to connect it. After about 20 minutes of fighting the connector, we finally got it.Then came the setup. Of course, we had to upgrade the software. That was about 20 minutes. It did not want to connect to our WiFi, but after entering it a few dozen times we got it. Our cable remote will not work, so I have to figure that out.The sound has no bass, none. The sound is like a $5.00 transistor radio.  We have played with the sound and have a touch of bass now, but not enough. I know that flat screen sound is often lacking, but our 20 year Sharp brand sounded pretty good.The picture I have not played with yet, but is very crisp. It is so crisp that all shows look like a soap opera. Sort of like the difference you can see between film and digital video. Just not very realistic.I know I am going to have to continue playing with the settings to get it like I want it, but am not looking forward to it.I want so much to like this tv, just do not know how long it will take to begin enjoying it, if I do!Edit: so I played around wit settings some, took some of the fake look out of the picture. Still have a little bit more to go yetEdit: I have had this TV for about 2 weeks now. No matter what adjustments we have made to the sound, nothing has helped. Also we had adjusted the picture about 15 times and finally had it where it looked decent. Then last night we streamed a movie and it looked so bad. I really don’t know if the TV is having an issue or if it is the adjustments. I don’t know why we have had TVs in our households for over 70 years and you always just took it out of the box and plugged it in and ALWAYS got an acceptable picture. Seems like those days are gone. Now you HAVE to mess with all of the adjustments and hope you can get something half way decent. I do not think you should have to call support to find out how to adjust the picture! Very VERY dissatisfied!",

    "My old tv that replace for this one had better view better picture quality and have others Samsung in my house but this is by far the worst tv",

    "Beautiful tv, fast shipping & delivery, easy setup!",

    "Exelente artículoMuy hermosa compra me encanto",

    "This is my fourth Samsung. I took the one previously in this spot and moved it to another room. Replaced with this more expensive, updated and “better” version. Picture quality is poor and unstable. It’s either washed out, or it’s randomly good. No one can work out how to make it permanently good quality. Likely have to go through the hassle of returning it,",

    "the television itself is good but the remote stopped working on me after 2 months.",

    "The things that most people will question is is it good picture or how does it sound; and to that I would say its in line with its price and is that it should meet your exceptations. HOWEVER, my biggest concerns going into this now are the little things.1. Power Supply - the placement is to the very far left and the cord is EXTREMELY short (it has the bent/curved outlet plug which may be appealing). Due to the layout of my home, this has been a challenge; not a Samsung issue, but if your outlet is on the right side of the TV, you will likely need an extension cord and its a small margin of space.2. Remote - SUPER SENSITIVE. I think sometimes if I look at it, a button is pressed. I would also like a few more buttons and/or better labeling (without the manual, its a guess on how to mute sound for new users).3. Software - Very slow to respond even with reasonable input. None of the smart features like Google integration work. It can stream via apps from the Samsumg store but an update may ruin their performance.Overall, its an okay television that I would say is better suited as a spare or infrequent use television.",

    "Came immediately - way quicker than expected. The picture is beautiful and the tv is very sleek.That being said- Set up is clunky. It wouldn’t accept my password a good 7/8 times, even though I didn’t have it hidden and could see it was entered correctly every time. It eventually worked, but had me going bananas for a minute- It lags. Processing speed on this is a bit rough. Flipping through channels takes an eternity. You’ll eventually just pick something out of frustration- The preloaded apps take up 51% of the space on the tv. Not a huge deal, but probably part of what makes the tv slow. Also surprising for the cost- Nightmarish Home Screen. I don’t think anyone tested this before putting it on the market. It works like an old school tv. When you turn it on, whatever you were watching last plays. Did you just finish a movie? It’ll start playing something from that channel. It’s really annoying to have an auto play feature that you can’t turn off (called customer support to confirm it can’t be stopped)On the plus side customer support picked up super quick.Overall it’s a nice tv, but I don’t think it’s worth the price. It’s made to look fancy, just that. You could get a much better tv for this price.",

    "I needed a new TV and was able to pay for this with the Amazon monthly payments.  I gave two stars to the remote that came with it.  I ordered the old kind separately....it seems simpler to operate.",

    "Love the size and picture quality. On bright days there is no impact on picture quality.",

    "Great picture (although when the camera pans it has a really weird effect, maybe it's motion blur and I can de-activate it) and all of the features are intuitive. I'm giving it only 4 stars because it's another Samsung TV that can't connect to Netflix and I still need to use my Chromecast. I have no idea what their problem is. Can't I just slowly type in my email/password? No I have to follow a broken 404 link for my convenience.",

    "Shipped efficiently and in one piece.",

    "Had the TV for a little over a month, and picture is defective. Amazon is replacing thankfully, and I went ahead and added the 4 year protection. Also, the speakers are TERRIBLE! Sound like they're blown and we haven't  turned it up past 60 volume. Bought the samsung sound bar since they're on a great deal right now. But wasn't expecting to have to buy one right away! Love the picture and overall quality of the TV when it was working correctly. Hoping the replacement has no issues. The remote control was a little frustrating to figure out. It's simplicity makes it a challenge to learn. Also the TV remote for Comcast cable control is terrible. Its extremely delayed when operating for cable.Update: Received new TV (2nd), but this one the picture randomly goes dark. I've tried messing with the settings, unplugging the TV and plug it back in, and no matter what I do, the picture will go dark, then go back to normal, then dark again, and so on as you're watching a show, movie, or playing a game. Returning this one and hope third time is the charm.Update: 3rd TV also randomly goes dark. The ambient light setting is turned off, along with motion detection, and screen saver. Not sure why they randomly dim and and get bright again. Returning and will be buying a different tv. Also, the controls terribly lag. It's really frustrating just trying to click on a different source or do anything in the settings. Get what you pay for I guess.",

    "Perfect",

    "Easy to setup with excellent picture quality with minor changes to sharpen picture from factory settings",

    "The TV is a great buy.. Took 8 hours to install over the fireplace due to not much space to work with regarding the stud behind the wall. Side note if installing over the fireplace you may need extenders in addition to the mount itself. Covered the entite fireplace as you can see from the pictures. I purchased my mount from best buy. TV this size has an expensive cost for the mount such as 200.00 plus for the mount itself. I’m used to installing 50 inch tVS. Lol it was worth it after the install. Great TV works well with xfinity cable service.",

    "Very happy with our Samsung! This was my first smart tv to set up by myself! Samsung made it easy with their scan code that directs you to download the smart things app! Once that’s done, it’s a simple set up; app adding is also easy to navigate! The picture is amazing, and the remote is also user friendly. Finally, great price!",

    "Wow! what can i say abt this smart tv?? it is by far the best and biggest tv i ever owned. I really love that it has alot of apps and it is very easy to use! Good job samsung! Im looking forward to buy another one in the future! The display is nice and bright also",

    "I bought this TV primarily to use with my PS4 (and hopefully PS5 one day...) and it has been doing a poor job thus far. Half the time it doesn't recognize the console and half the time it does. Despite scouring the internet and the Samsung message boards I have yet to find an answer that resolves the issue. I've tried 3 different HDMI cords (none of which reliably seem to do the job) yet I can easily hook up the console to my old PC monitor without issue. This definitely seems to be a pervasive problem as well based on research I was conducting to solve my own problem.",

    "Like TV, but warranty is not reliable!",

    "Pros:-great picture-built in TV guide for OTA tvCons:-No source button in the remoteSet up is overly complicated and unnecessary. You have to set up all the Samsung wifi and smart features in order to watch anything-built in chromecast feature doesn't support casting from computers or apps that are not available on the TV.-unable to remove the 'Samsung tv' internet channels. These 'free channels' are absolute garbage. The crap channels that get bundled with your cable box are better than these.- Samsung tv channels are located in the same input as your cable/antenna instead of being a seperate appPlease manufacturers, make some 'dumb' tvs again. I don't want your Spyware apps that sell my viewing habits and displays additional advertisements, with built in apps that'll stop being updated and supported after the TV is a few years old. Give me a TV that I can plug in devices and watch TV without all the unnecessary apps and necessary wifi integration",

    "Couldn't wait to get this 85 samsung in the movie room. The picture is horrible! It's the worst picture resolution I've had. I have 7 Samsung TVs.  We buy Samsung because we have Samsung cell phones and we like the casting option. All of our TVs have very good pictures. We have tried every setting to try and improve the picture quality with no success. We have a Samsung curved 65 in all the way down to 32 inch Samsungs. I would not recommend this TV to anybody. Hard to say considering every electronic device we own is Samsung washer,dryer, frigerator, cell phones Ect.... it's hard for me not to recommend this tv but I honestly, I would be lying if I said it was worth it, that you get used to it and you don't notice the poor image quality after awhile. It gets more noticeable everytime I turn it on. There is no blacks, it can only get to a dark grey and at 85 the picture looks really hazy because it's dark gray where it should be black.",

    "WiFi works great and picture quality is superb",

    "Se mira muy bien y la calidad de imagen",

    "Very easy to set up, high quality. I’ve always bought the cheap tvs and thought “okay this is worth my money” this was a little more expensive and it’s a very noticeable difference. It’s hard to judge with buying things sight unseen, but it was well worth it.",

    "Great picture, light weight, easy to set up both tv and my dish remote to work with it.  But running dish  with the TV remote a different story.",

    "Initial findings - On the 65-inch, the feet are 42 inches apart. You are probably going to need at least 50 inches to stand it on, if you aren't going for a wall mount.Still working to get my own sound bar set up - got a little bit of echo, due to a slight timing difference - but once the subwoofer is plugged in, it's still better for my suspect hearing.Now, I just need to move my chair back - it's been about 90 inches from my old 42-inch plasma TV at at this distance it's all a bit too much.The remote sucks. How can anyone expect a 10-15 button remote to get it all done, IDK. But pairing my cable company remote was easy enough.",

    "I purchased this TV for my 85yr old mom because her eyesight was fading.  The size of the picture is wonderful since it has a minimal frame.The picture was wonderful and to see my mom smile so hard when my brother & I turned on the TV, was priceless!I highly recommend this TV for everyone to enjoy!",

    "The picture quality is great when the tv actually works.. over than that simply don’t buy it’s actually a terrible tv. I was thinking that because it was Samsung that it would be decent wrong it literally stopped working two wild into buying it",

    "So many different options to choose from .A 65 inch TV for under $700 . It’s 1 inch thick . Light weight . Very high quality picture . Couldn’t be happier . The picture is so clear it’s almost fake looking .  Set up was very easy . Highly recommended .",

    "Samsung would not make an exception to their unpublished warranty that apparently states 90 days warranty for TV's used in a business environment.  Only warranty I saw indicated 1yr with no asterix or notes to indicate there was more to the policy.",

    "This TV was great until today. I've had it for 3.5 months. When I turned it on today, I got this. It has not fallen or had anything hit it. I live alone and never even touch it. But where the green line is, there is a tiny crack at the top of the screen. It had to have been there the whole time because nothing has happened to it. It is now too late to return and it's not even paid for yet. Very upset about this.",

    "Bought to replace a 42 from the 1990's, this TV is just incredible all around.  It pretty much sets itself up.  You plug in all your stuff and then turn it on.  Then, as if by magic, the TV sets up all your peripherals.  As neat as the TV is, the packaging my even be cooler.  The packaging is an engineered system designed to protect the TV during transit - and it does this well.  You simply cut the two plastic band straps, open it up, and it all comes apart.  No cutting, no ripping, no snatching, and no tearing.  The box was so well designed, I hate to throw it away.",

    "I am writing this negative report mainly for the user interface. It is horrible!!! Navigating, signing in to Apps, controlling the Bluetooth devices, etc is pathetic! I am so disappointed with Samsung in the design of the user interface and menu navigation with this TV. The picture quality is great, but they ruined the most basic feature of this smart TV; the user interface. Another BIG problem is that unlike other smart TV operating systems like FIre TV or Roku, Samsung uses their own version. You will find that many apps that you love and have installed on your other devices are not found on the Samsung applications selection; really, really bad!",

    "After assembling and plugging in, I used Samsung SmartThings (on my phone) to connect the TV to wifi and voila! 4k/UHD video and good stereo sound.(note: SmartThings simplifies initial set-up, not required).There are multiple high-level picture options; detailed video configuration settings are available.Picture quality is excellent. Displays SD and HD content well also.Samsung TV Plus provides many free TV channels via internet.There is a content app catalog (netflix, prime video, youtube, etc.). Most were easy to connect; a few are complicated.The TV control paddle is ultra simple to use.A PC can be used as an HDMI input device.The Samsung Soundbar HW-Q950A was simple to add. Plug in to power and the TV (eARC), and immediately had movie theater-quality Dolby Atmos sound. No speaker wiring or any configuration was needed; audio settings are available.The TV is heavy, and difficult for one person to move easily - it is so big. Recommend having it delivered to its intended room.I used the TV's included stand legs placed on a base. The legs can attach at a choice of two heights and also two widths.",

    "Noce upgrade  for 1080p samsung smart tv  love the new interface and the picture and sounds is much better !  the 43 inch tv is about the same size as the 32 inch and is thinner and lighter",

    "I have purchased many Tvs, and currently own over 10 flat panel TVs in a large high-tech home.  This TV has  all the ports you need, and has fantastic picture quality.  However, the hardware for the smart part of the TV is lacking, and using the remote control is a pain as the TV responds very VERY slowly to remote command, causing you to push the same button over again to make sure you pushed it, and then causing the TV to respond to the extra button pushes and do something you did not intend. I assume this is because they starved the TV for memory to save money, and there is no option to add memory.  That is a MAJOR flaw.  Also, some of the software settings in the setup section simply DO NOT work.  If all you want is a great picture, then this is a bargain, but it suffers from cheap construction in software and hardware. This is NOT a high end TV.",

    "I can't believe how much I was missing when I upgraded from a 39 tv to a 50 tv. Crystal, Crisp, Clear picture screen with vibrant colors for a visual wonder. Great sound as well.",

    "Excellent product",

    "Picture quality great, sound could be better. Plenty of apps Google voice and alexa present.",

    "Picture and sound quality are decent, everything else blows.  The whole TV flexes like it's made of wet paper mache.  The remote is janky as hell, on several occasions simply touching the remote would change channel or open/close an app, turn the tv on or off etc.  After less than 6 months the remote has stopped working all-together.  The device settings don't save or don't affect its function.  Despite being set to go home on startup 50-50 shot it says hdmi not connected (it isn't connected) or Gordon Ramseys Kitchen Nightmares...",

    "Two stars for a couple of reasons.  First, Amazon delivered my TV (65) in a neighborhood at 5:45 AM and left it leaning against the front of the house.  A HUGE box within 20 feet of the street before sunrise and didn't bother ringing the bell (I can understand why).  The only reason I found they had made the delivery was the email I opened about 6:30 AM.  I couldn't believe it.After unpacking and setting up the TV, the sound doesn't work.  AT ALL.  New TV, undamaged with a great picture, but no sound.  My options?  Send it back for exchange to Amazon or wait for a repair tech to come and work on it.  I'm still waiting.Remote is very simplistic - almost as Spartan as an Apple TV remote.  I'm still figuring it out.  Smart TV apps aren't automatically loaded like my last two LG TV's, so that's a pain.  If you're used to using a ROKU or FireStick, this will take a little getting used to.",

    "The sound did not work, checked settings everything seemed ok.  I am most disapointed that the TV was obviously used and not new as ordered.  The protective wrappings were missing and when I was troubleshooting the sound I opened Netflix and there was someones else's account logged on to the TV.  This is an absolute diapointment with Amazon, and making me rethink the quality and originality of products ordered.",

    "I read many of the reviews. I disagree with those who awarded less than 4 stars. Great picture. Sound, remote all work well. Samsung plus offers over 100 free channels. Some will appeal to most viewers. Easy to access streaming services.",

    "I give it 5 stars but idk if this is normal or not because my Samsung S6000 50 tv has a bottom plate but this didn't really? Idk I took a picture of it to get other people's opinions or maybe the company can get it? But other than that it's pretty legit TV",

    "As someone who has owned Samsung TV’s for 15 years and loved them, I’m incredibly disappointed with the poor picture quality/brightness of this. It’s literally impossible to watch tv during the day even with the brightness turned all the way up. Unless you plan on ONLY watching tv in a pitch black room, spend a little more and get a better model.",

    "Getting a replacement from Amazon (good on Amazon) but wow, to develop a line in only 2 months of having it. Hoping the replacement does better.",

    "Great tv for the price .",

    "The remote control offers a little to be desired, but it is definitely 5stars in every other way!! It’s the best TV I have ever owned period! I don’t know about all the technical aspects but it’s just the clearest most vibrant TV I have ever owned! I highly recommend it!!!",

    "Although The TV has a beautiful Picture, and the sound isn't great, my last samsung, had better sound. I found it to be very confusing to install. 1st you need a Samsung Account, before you can install the TV. Also all the information on how to install the TV is hidden inside on their web site. You can follow the steps, but the voice activated TV repeats everything you type. The remote was & still is an issue, wish it had more functions.",

    "I bought the 75” TV. First day of using it and unboxing, the packaging (box) was great it had no dents or damage. I had no problem receiving the TV in great quality, it was not cracked, or damaged. The thinness of the TV amazed me as it was extremely easy to carry and mount. Quality of the movies and videos are excellent, i am obsessed with the size I feel like I am in a AMC at home. The features im still trying to figure out, it has Alexa built in and others. The control is very basic and I feel like it’s a pro bc it’s not confusing. You can also control the TV from the app on your phone. As I browse through the TV I will update the review!!",

    "Volume extremely low? Don't tap the up and down buttons...push up or down to increase or decrease the T.V.'s sound. This was never clear in the comments and I almost started a RETURN.

    "Great picture crystal clear well value",

    "Such a beautiful TV but was completely defective out of the box. The remote would not connect even though we reset it. Apps would not load or open even though it was connected to the internet. It was bad luck after another. I'm sure a working version of this television would of been amazing. The color quality was beautiful nothing I had ever owned before.",

    "Totalmente desilusionadoLlego con la pantalla totalmente rota.",

    "My 65 curved Samsung 4k from a couple years ago shows better than this TV. I was trying to upgrade to this whole crystal hype thing. But it turns out this TV is not only cheaper, it is more blurry and very VERY blurry. I mean on the Youtube app alone, you can see all the fonts/letters are blurry and not crisp and clear like my older Samsung curved 4k. Also the blacks are very muddy and not true black.  I think what happened here, they lowered the quality of the TV to make more profit and lower the price as well.  If your reading this, dont fall for the cheap price like I did! It is more of a gimmick than a true Samsung display. I am so shocked that I have to return a 8000 series Samsung 4k TV for not having good picture quality. Stuff like this is why I have trust issues.",

    "This purchase is our second Samsung 65 in less than a year. Of al the high quality TV monitors  I've specified professionally over the years. Samsung has outperformed others in customer feedback and satisfaction for the picture quality, color and sound performance.",

    "I will be honest, when I decided to purchase a TV from Amazon site unseen I was a bit skeptical. I found this TV in the 65” size and I was a bit confused by the cost. So OCD me kicked in and I went to YouTube watching video after video and for someone like me when those tech guys started talking about OLED vs QLED vs Nano vs whatever it might as well have been an F-15 doing a flyby. I am positive there are better more defined TVs with rockets and flame throwers out there but for the money this one is excellent! 10 out of 10 I would buy again!",

    "This TV is the best. You do not need CABLE, ever !!  I have prime video, Netflix and then this TV. I can watch whatever I want on a crystal clear beautiful screen. And I installed it all by myself. I am not tech savvy at all. So you get the picture. It self installs itself. I got the 65” for my living room, and ran right back and got the 50” for my bedroom. I got free HBO max with my purchase. A Win win for affordability and luxury, if you ask me. Samsung and Amazon, best team up, ever.",

    "Remote does not work.  Sensors on tv do not work.  Tv would not connect to internet.  Terrible purchase.  Amazon customer was great!",

    "Not much to like. Who wants to start watchong a program (ota, streaming, no difference) only to have tv bounce to a completely different place while advertising the wonders of samsung?",

    "The only thing I didn't like about this is you NEED to make a Samsung account to use it properly. It requests far too much data for a TV. Geeze. It took quite a while to set up. Far longer than any TV in the past. But it has built in Amazon fire which is nice.",

    "The remote has no numbers on it so you can't hit 8 and go to channel 8, also never figured out the volume button because it only went one way.  The other big bomb was it  does not have closed caption.  My tv's that are 15 years old have CC.  Its there but says this is not active .  Guess you could use this just for apps if you don't have anyone in your house that needs CC and doesn't mind sending a lot of time looking for local channels. Think you have to go to home then hit samsung channels then search from there.  It wasted my entire day so not pleased with it, having to rebox and return it to another town and reset up my old one.  Its A is for awful",

    "I am very pleased with this tv and how easy it was to set up.  The picture quality is excellent and it was easy to attach to a wall mount.  I easily got into all my apps like netflix, youtube, hulu, etc.  No complaints except for the volume control on the remote, but luckily I have a samsung universal remote and use it on that.",

    "The picture on this TV looks whitewashed.  I tried everything possible in settings and googled picture settings just in case I missed something.  Every channel appears different.  I have other Samsung TV's and they are great.  This one is not good.  Cannot get in tough with Samsung.  I hope Amazon posts this review.  I never give a one star review but this is the exception.Update:After 5 months we turn on the tv and it's whitewashed.  Go into settings, picture and click on picture and the whitewash goes away.  We have to do this every time we turn this piece of garbage on.  5Samsung tv's in our home but this one is terrible.  Tried everything even reset but no luck.  Throwing it away one day but for now we will keep making the adjustment.  Once we go into settings and picture the tv is fine.  I've never seen so many bac reviews for a product on Amazon.  DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!!!",

    "Got this tv in July, just today voice button stopped working and all other buttons I have to hit 2 or 3 times for the tv to respond. New batteries and all settings are where they should be. Nothing blocking tv. Not sure if sensor in tv going bad or the remote.",

    "This TV is awesome! I am a gamer so if I have one game console on and decide to switch to another all I have to do is turn on the other console and the TV will switch inputs automatically. Coolest thing ever. But I do have a big complaint on the speakers. Very poor quality, that's why I dropped a star on it. I recommend to get a sound bar to go with this TV. But other than that, it's great!",

    "The picture is worse than a 15 year old 24 inch tv.  It's advertised as being better than average and is so much worse.  Not worth the money.  Our visio is much better picture and sound.",

    "I liked the TV just fine. The problem is that this TV is in our bedroom and at night we noticed that when he TV is turned off it makes a ticking sound almost like a ticking clock. That noise continues all night and during any time he TV is off. We tried unplugging it an that stooped the noise but added an inconvenience. We had it plugged into a surge protector so we tried plugging it directly into the outlet. The Samsung was a replacement for an LG 55 TV and we never had that problem before.  So Amazon was great about replacing the TV with another identical TV.  We plugged it in and got it all set up. when we turned it off it started making the same ticking noise.",

    "My LG 55 inch was destroyed by a lightening surge so I switched to Samsung. Great color for my tv sports and streaming. The speaker are ok. The frame is a bit flexible but the unit is very thin. The remote is limited to a few options but that may be due to having dish network. I use the dish network remote and it's fine.  I had challenges with LG but they were always satisfied by the extended warrantee. I made the switch primarily due to pricing.  I also downsize from a 55 to 50 inch. It has many apps and smart features. With my added speaker box the surround sound is impressive. I would purchase it again. This is an entry level television and provides the viewing pleasure I want and the quality I expect.",

    "Amazing picture",

    "I watch informational videos about cake on here mostly.",

    "The initial setup went well .  Beautiful picture and has very good sound quality.  Able to hear speech pretty well.  I immediately noticed a lip-sync issue that gave me concern with no apparent way to fix it.  However today I learned there is a firmware update from Samsung only available via USB installation that resolves the sync issue.  I just installed the update and yes it fixes the problem.  Now I am very happy.  That said, I think it would be in the best interest of Samsung to communicate this issue very clearly to new TV buyers.  I was close to returning the TV until I learned there was a fix to the lip-sync issue.",

    "Voice control doesn’t work",

    "straight out of the box, junk, screen was dark, I thought samsung was a decent brand, now gotta go through the hassle of returning",

    "Awesome television",

    "Best tv for the mid range budget. Seamless casting, decent picture quality for UHD.",

    "Reasonable price, delivered undamaged and great quality picture.  Smart features including voice command all work well.  Very happy with my Samsung Smart TV.",

    "Clear picture easy to put together doing wireless👍👍",

    "Really nice tv too bad it was defected. Half of the screen was darker. Something I immediately noticed, although the picture was fine there was something wrong with the backlighting for sure. I had to send this back, not going to allow this. Sorry Samsung your quality has gone down the drain.",

    "Picture Quality is amazing Features are great, But The speakers in the TV not so Much I'm going to add a Sound Bar! You Have to get any Good sound out of it!",

    "Picture is great",

    "Not worth the Samsung branding they’re known for.",

    "Lots of pixel lines across the screen. I never even got to set it up. However, props to Amazon for easy returns.",

    "To watch TV",

    "Good",

    "This TV is easy to install and use.  We live the clear picture.",

    "The TV is great for the first two months. After that period, the internals are designed to fail and allow Samsung to implement their “insurance” Samsung+ where you get an equal or lesser tv. This happened to me but worse. Samsung uses the same tv parts as Vizio and Hisense. And Vizio and Hisense’s customer service will help you. Stay away from any newer Samsung products as they are all manufactured cheaper and ready to fail.",

    "The remote doesn’t work. After the tv is on for three minutes it makes a rapid clicking sound at different tones than powers off and on. Defective capacitors. Total disappointment. Buyer beware",

    "Love it so much, great quality",

    "This is awesome, the edge to edge display make movies and games feel more realistic. The voice controls works with Alexa,Samsung Bixby and Google now voice commands. 🎥  it's totally recommended especially for gaming.",

    "its super sleek and the picture quality is bright and gorgeous. There is hardly any screen cut off (top or bottom) and the set up was very easy and thorough",

    "I was really nervous about ordering a tv through amazon. But the tv was delivered earlier than expected, packaged well and works perfectly.",

    "The picture quality is outstanding for its level however when I turn the TV off, I get this clicking sound all night long.  I hate to have to send it back since I threw away the box but it's quite annoying when you are trying to sleep.",

    "This TV is great. The picture quality is wonderful and the size (43 inch) is perfect for my space. When I game, my experience is almost as good as my 55 inch TV. I just about everything. The only things I don't like are how sensitive the remote is and the sound quality.I barely touch the remote or I put my game controller on top of it and the screen immediately goes from my consoles source to the TV guide and I'll have to change it back. It's very frustrating, especially if I'm watching a movie or something... and the sound quality is very tinny sounding. I understand it would be a lot better with a sound bar, but I had fairly high hopes since this is a Samsung TV.Overall, though, I am impressed and the setup was super easy.",

    "Have had Samsung TV's for years and are always easy to use and look great..",

    "I haven't figured out why the subtitles goes real small sometimes, otherwise great tv!",

    "I have bought a lot of TVs but this is the best by far. I’m flabbergasted by how real it looks hey super smart Internet controls using your smart phone but the remote could use some improvement.  Amazing picture and speed.",

    "Easy mounting. Beautiful picture",

    "This tv is lovely in a lot of ways, so much so that we attempted to buy it twice. The problem is that it makes a ticking/drip drip noise when turned off that will drive you mad. Unfortunately I will be returning for the second time (we had the 55” one). The 50” one we bought for upstairs didn’t have this problem, so not sure if it’s a problem with the models of this particular size. I’m not going to try a third time.",

    "This is s good TV, accidentally ordered smaller size going to order bigger size soon.",

    "I've done my research and most of the current reviews of this product are true. Not a great brightly lite room television. Also lacks the ability to adjust the backlight. Best when in low/no light conditions.  Not a fan of the remote either... upside, the remotes for my other Samsung tvs work for this model too!Otherwise its a great entry level, super thin, above average picture quality (in low light) television.  Worth every penny, but not anymore.",

    "Great TV but the color is off and it cannot be adjusted to a more natural tone. 4 out of 5 stars",

    "Piece of junk. Less than 2 months and already got the black screen of death",

    "Best T.V I have purchased so far. The picture quality is almost as good as the $3000 display ones at Best Buy. Easy to set up and works great with my ps5. The 65inch looks gorgeous and completely worth the price tag.",

    "Unbelievable clarity and color,sharpest picture",

    "The picture quality is amazing. For the money you can't get any better than this, the quality is up there with much more expensive televisions. The only knock I have is the sound, it's not very loud, but with a surround system you don't notice.",

    "This TV has an excellent picture!",

    "Updated review:Not happy with this Samsung TV. Initially, it's look good but later I realized the picture/video quality could have been better considering the price range. It is not good compare to my LG 65 TV. My another TV is far better than this one. Pixel density is not up to the mark.",

    "Excellent quality aside from sound.",

    "Replaced an LG tv with this Samsung. Having Charter/Spectrum as cable & internet provider allowed me to connect via Wi-Fi instead of paying for a set top cable box.",

    "Delivery as expected in good condition. Easy set up.  Not a fan of the remote but may be better once I figure it all out.",

    "This tv is ok when you are watching it when there is some light in the room. However, to enjoy that cinematic experience, when i make the room dark- white cloudy patches are very apparent ruining the experience. Amazon wont replace the tv because its over 1 month since i bought the tv. They asked me to reach out to manufacturer - who are not very responsive. Will update this review if anything changes",

    "This TV replaced my recent 50. Much bigger screen. Superb quality. Makes watching the NFL and Formula 1 much better. Apps are good and fast. No complaints at all.",

    "Very slow ..!!The tv getting stuckWon’t even turn ofDisconnected from the power to shut it offReturning after one day of use",

    "i can’t even explain how clear everything look on this TV, it’s worth buying.",

    "Super nice pic. Simplified remote which I like. Love it!",

    "We are full timer RV travelers and our old 32 inch Samsung was wore out!  Did some research, settled on this one and WOW - great picture!  Lightning fast set up and connected to everything!",

    "Delivered quite quickly,not damage to shipping box, opened box, looked ok, screen looked fine,set tv up plugged it in and upon powering up tv set screen was severely damaged. Company that sold tv required pictures, no problem I get it but it took way too long to get my $787.99credit . I was told it would take ten days for my credit to show up. I waited 10 days called the company and said where’s my credit.I was told sorry It was over looked. Oh boy! I did finally get my credit but this purchase was not worth the hassle",

    "Tried to purchase at Walmart, damaged and poor service. Ordered for same price on here, delivered safely and in great shape the next week - it is amazing picture and sound. Love the smart features!",

    "If you look at the back panel, you will see how there were more plugs there that were covered by makeshift plastic panels.  This is what companies do nowadays to force people to buy more stuff.  RCA outputs and 1/8 inch output is still the industry standard, however TVs like this one decided that that's a thing of the past.  So if you have an old TV hi-fi system, you will need to get a new one or spend time on an an adapter that converts digital out to RCA.For some reason, the older soundbars that have an optical cable will also not work with this TV.  But if you get a new Samsung soundbar, it'll integrate beautifully!My review:CONS: TV deliberately missing outputs.  Color distortion when watching TV at extreme angle.  Built-in speakers are utter garbagePROS: Ease of use, great vivid colors when viewing at normal angles, easy navigation, more than enough apps and they are extremely intuitive.  TV is very very thin.  It barely even has room to say Samsung... and finally....Samsung TV is built in, and it's free.  Samsung gives you an insane amount of channels that you can access for free if you are connected to the internet.  You can watch Newsmax, all your local ABC/NBC's, music video channels, cooking channels, etc.  Who needs cable anymore if you have all of this + Netflix and Amazon prime?Bottom line: just be prepared that your old sound system will not work with this, unless you want to get some kind of an adapter.  Otherwise a fantastic TV.",

    "So incredibly frustrating to unbox a 75 TV, put the mount on, and then have it just turn off every 30 seconds. Mind you, we got up at 6am for the delivery. Sooooo infuriating. Don't waste your money, Best Buy is cheaper and will deliver. Target is also cheaper but you have to pick up.",

    "This is the second tv I’ve purchased from Amazon. It was still a quality buying experience. ALRIGHT AMAZON",

    "I have bought at least seven of these recently , for my house, and for relatives, as well as for work (I am a sound / light / AV integrator), so I use everything from consumer to super expensive 70 touch screens...with that said, these are my favorite. Very easy to use, intuitive remote (the LG remote systems are awful!!!)...good smart tv features, great picture and great price...by far the best TV you will get for $700. Highly recommend.",

    "This is the second Samsung TV we've owned and neither of them lasted more 2-1/2 years.  Don't buy!",

    "When I purchased this tv I did not sign up for a used television. If that was the case I could have gone to a pawn shop. Will be returning or I need a discount",

    "Be careful what you are buying. Price was great but you get what you pay for. Looks great on the wall until you turn it on. We had friend over to watch a game they could not believe that this was a new T.V. due to the quality and clarity of the picture.",

    "Great for the price!",

    "Picture is beautiful. Nice slim design. Speakers are horrible but I get it. Thin speakers thin sound. I was going to plug it into a receiver with better speakers anyway. It doesn't have variable volume out. I find this to suck. Older models to CRT tvs have this feature. Instead of setting my receiver to a fixed volume and using the 1 remote I have to use 2 remotes. Not that smart.update. Finally figured out the hdmi arc system for using single remote and variable volume out . you will not get help from samsung. you will not talk to a product specialist but someone in India in front of a computer that tells them what to say. good for simple stuff but not complex issues.  Next the Alexa sucks. sometime it works fine other not at all. Even when its working, it understands you like 20% of the time and constantly tries to sell you stuff. All my alexa stuff sucks.",

    "There is a cloud looking stain in the bottom left corner they weren’t able to help me dicectly from Samsung support and directly from Amazon so I’m going to need to return",

    "Great picture and easy to set up. This is my 2nd TV of this model in 2yrs. Made a great choice here.Thank me !!",

    "Thing is hard to set up.  Bought a roku and that did not help much. Still do not have it set up.  Can not stand the irritating voice associated with this thing.  Bought it Saturday and this is Tuesday.  Every time you hit a button that nails on a chalk board voice starts.  If I had to listen to this voice for the rest of my like I think I would hang myself, just about there now.  If I can not find a regular TV I will just have to do without.",

    "Perfect choice for the average household. Gets the job done, and has good picture quality.The remote isn’t super intuitive, but it’s easy to get the hang of",

    "Got the 65 inches and the quality of it is impressive",

    "Arrived today in excellent condition, with an undamaged shipping box. Easy set up. Very sharp & crisp picture with no dead spots. It's definitely heavy! Like others said, the Remote is tiny with very few buttons & the internal TV Speaker doesn't have much Bass or Volume. So you may want a Sound Bar. I turned on expert set up for sound & added an EQ, set it up for a clarity & volume boost. Definitely a good purchase for the cost. Needing a new TV is always a challenge to make the right call.",

    "This TV is thin. That was the main reason I purchased this model. The ridiculously priced thin mount is the only way I found to get this TV flush mounted. Picture is good. No difference from my LG. Sound is as expected, not great. I purchased a sound bar. My biggest Disappointment is that this 2021 smart tv ,that was not cheep, does not come with the smartThings app. I was planning on using the TV with my Ring doorbell. You need the app for that Apparently Samsung feels like including the app to make your smart tv truly smart is only reserved for those who are willing to spend more to get something that should come standard. I wont purchase a Samsung again.",

    "There is nothing to like about this product. Picture quality is poor. Sound is poor. Samsung offers no realistic support. I cannot play DVDs. It will not record programs. The remote control is too complicated. Elderly people should be warned that this TV is just too difficult to operate.",

    "Arrived extremely well packaged.  Amazon had this delivered in a special truck whose driver & helper called before arriving and took great care offloading the box at 0800.  Very respectful and cheery lads evn that early in the morn.  Setup was a breeze with easy on screen walk through for WIFI, internet, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu etc.  Picture quality is superb with no adjustment necessary.  Feels as if you are right there, a part of the programs.  Remote though, does not allow for the volume to increase or decrease; will sync my provider's remote to solve.  This was a great purchase as have been all my previous Samsung's.  Still have my 8 year old Samsung tele, functioning like new.  This brand stands strong on its own and delivers on quality.  Will always be a supporter of this brand which stands behind its name.",

    "Wonderful picture .. great sound ...I love this tv",

    "Wonderful picture quality, a little problem trying to figure out how to use the remote but we got over it! Love this television, being color blind this picture is so clear that I can see more color!",

    "This tv is great nice picture good sound. Unfortunately the remote didn’t work straight out the box so I already had to buy a replacement.",

    "beautiful TV. 43 perfect for apartment",

    "TV was broken before I could even watch it.",

    "Delivered in perfect condition. Obscenely easy to unbox and setup. I set it up and moved it around myself with no issues. Setup instructions are all images go show you exactly what needs to be done. Remote is easy peasy (the bar buttons on the bottom move up and down and can also be pressed. Ie. Left bar can be pushed once for mute, or you can turn volume up by clicking button upward and vice versa). Surprised at the quality for only paying $600! Looking forward to movie nights on this guy.",

    "I am a big fan of Samsung so I stuck to this Samsung and I am very pleased with the quality and ease of use.Samsung makes great products and this has a lot of great features. However, I did have to have my kids help me link some accounts with some of the other apps apps, but it was pretty easy to do.This is nothing against the TV but more of a personal note. I wish these smart TV's still had a few RCA jacks in the back so you can hook up older stereo surrounding or surround equipment. But that's old school and this is the future.I'm very happy with the quality and price of this TV!  So much that I bought a 50 Samsung Smart TV and it is just as nice as this this one.",

    "Love the picture.  The streaming features and remote are not what I hoped for.",

    "Works well. Colors are good. Picture is clear. Sound a bit off. But over all good buy.",

    "This model is notorious for a manufacture defect. Bottom left corner of panel, you hear a drip, drip, drip, while the TV is off. Same issues with the Costco variant of the au800d. You may not here this in a larger family room, but it will def keep you up at night when you are trying to sleep in a small, quiet room. Buyer Beware.",

    "Wonderful",

    "You would think that by buying a name brand you would be sheltered from certain basic issues but this is all in the head, not a fact. I bought this TV less than a month ago and already have 2 irritating issues. The TV randomly turns itself on in the middle of the night. This happened twice. This is not my first smart TV and I never had that issue before. The second issue is when watching a movie file via a USB key, the USB key gets disconnected randomly and doesn't show in your sources anymore. You have to remove it and plug it back in. Than the issue starts again. I'm not the only one experiencing this. You can google the issue and find other people who have had that same issue as far back as 2019 (So goodluck). I tried to resolve it with tech support but there are like robot. They tell you to do things you would already do like unplugging the TV, trying a different USB key and finally offer a factory reset that is not garantee to fix the  problem. Fortunately I can still return and try a different brand.",

    "I really wanted a smart tv that would streamline all of our subscriptions. Instead I ended up with a wannabe smart device with the slowest interface you can ever Imagine. Like windows 95 slow. It makes me not even want to use it. Terrible 4 button remote that forces you to scroll through SLOWLYalso too many apps. Too busy. Honestly just corporate UX malfeasance at its worst. I wish I could send this tv back",

    "Been trying to change from HDMI input to Antenna for three days now. The remote has no words on it to tell what the buttons do. Push them all and see meaningless stuff pop up on the screen. Obviously Samsung has been working fulltime fixing stuff that ain't broke. Why should the simplest of tasks be so complicated that after three days of screwing around, I still can't switch over to the Antenna input?",

    "Love the tv, nice quality. Interface was good, the only drawback I would say is the control, I get the layout but I think a better design would work better. No big deal because we also have a roku which the remote is stupid easy. Other than that awesome tv.",

    "Out of the box the screen was terribly scratched and the TV wouldn’t turn on. Will not buy another Samsung",

    "This is the second AU8000 that I've purchased. Whenever anything is plugged into the HDMI ports, the sound crackles. It does it on and off for at least 20 seconds at a time. The first one started doing it after almost a month. The second one started almost immediately out of the box. I have never had an issue with any of my other samsung tvs, including the one I had for five years before I had purchased this one. It's such a bizarre issue to have. Also, I read up on the issue and on samsung's website, they said it could be an electrical issue or a ventilation issue. Two things that it can't be in my case. Firstly, this is plugged into a massive surge protector with up to only three other devices ever plugged in at any given time. As far as ventilation, it is not even mounted to a wall, which I might understand. However, it is sitting on a tv stand, at least 10 inches from the wall. And nothing else is around it. I'm not saying this is a horrible unit, but that flaw is unbearable and from what I've been told by Samsung customer service several times, unfixable. Other than that issue the TV worked great. So if you never plug anything in the hdmi ports, it might still be for you.",

    "My TV feels like i'm at the movies, excellent picture quality and I am 150% satisfied with my purchase!!!!",

    "This tv is the most frustrating device I have ever experienced. Way too complicated to enjoy. If I hadn't thrown away the box I would return it for something simpler. Amazon, if it is possible to return it I would do so and buy a friendlier tv from you in exchange.",

    "Easy to install, excellent picture quality and easy to use.",

    "What can I say ! It lives up to every expectation. No delivery issues , no damaged parts , works seemlessly it’s a 10/10.Will update within a year .",

    "Nice",

    "If you want HD quality where the actors on the screen look like they are sitting in your room, then you must buy at least a 65 inch TV. I am so happy and a 65 inch Samsung's pic is so much better than the Samsung 55 inch I am replacing. Now, about the remote - ugggg! Hate it! It looks just like the Amazon Fire Stick remote. If you like click, click, click, adjust, click, blah, yada, yada, then you will probably love the remote. Luckily, I have three Samsung smart hub remotes that work with this TV (and you might want to buy one after this TV arrives). To use this remote is almost like having to reset your user name and passwords for the first time when setting up this TV. Here is an example: If I want to watch channel 32, I want to press a 3 and then a 2 on the remote. I do not want to open the secret numeric menu on my TV and scroll over to 3, then scroll to 2, then click on the OK button. Heaven forbid I want to friggin surf or jump back and forth. So hence with this lack of surfing, I am still using my cable box remote as well - LOL!!!On a great note: This TV requires nothing except a power plug and wifi connection. You can put it in areas where you do not have a cable or box - Love that as I live in a 1980's built condo with lack of strategic connections, no attic, or crawl space.You will not need a Fire Stick or Roku with this TV, everything is loaded.",

    "You will get your moneys worth out of this TV",

    "excelente",

    "Really great display with thin bezels and game mode. It also has come custom apps and the options to cast and screen mirror from iphone.",

    "i liked the television and it is still working. the remote will turn off the television but not turn it on if it has been turned off by Alexa, and i have to turn off and on the surge suppressor  to get it to respond to its remote control again. OF GREATER CONCERN the last several weeks it has been LEAKING a clear fluid. at first i thought it was condensation or my cat, there is no hole but the leak occurs very slowly , slightly sticky very clear fluid that is by its lack of smell NOT from my cat. the leak seems to be coming thru the plastic on the back, left lower 1/9th of the panel near the inputs. of course it began right after the return period expired.....",

    "Great picture, work well with Alexa, very easy to install, light and skinny speakers are ok for it's size but probably you will want to connect to a Bluetooth sound system for better sound, I have it connected to wifi and no problem streaming at all. I will recommend it for small spaces.",

    "Our 6 year old Vizio TV was knocked out by a lightning strike, so a new TV was imperative.  I did quite a bit of research on TV's less than $1,000.  This Samsung model fit my needs and was rated very well.The picture quality is outstanding compared with my old Vizio.  At my age, I don't see paying another $1,000+ to get further picture improvement.  I'm quite happy with the colors, contrast, refresh rate, etc.The downsides:If you don't own a soundbar, the audio is really inadequate compared the with video.  But, there are bluetooth options, optical and HDMI connectivity, so remedies exist.The remote takes a bit of learning time.  It isn't all that intuitive.  However, good instructions exist on line and after an hour or so, most of the necessary remote functions can be learned.Overall, I'm quite happy with the purchase and would recommend it to others.  Amazon delivery was great.",

    "Like the tv but hate the remote control.",

    "Every streaming platform I use was avaliable and I can use my phone to control my TV.",

    "wifi on tv does not work anymore in less than 2 months of owning , now have to send back for replacement if can , picture decent but wifi does not work , b.s.",

    "I'm a Samsung fan, had high hopes for this TV especially for the price. Picture is great but TV has some annoying issues.Pros:-Great 4k picture.-Connects and works great with Samsung SmartThings.-5G WIFI and Ethernet.-All the apps you need, GUI looks nice, easy to use.Cons:-Sound is terrible (but that's typical on these ultra thin TV's, no room for real speakers).-Remote goes into some kind of sleep mode, if you haven't used it in a few hours the first button press wakes the remote up and the second press then does what you want. Annoying to have to press the button twice.-Very slow to launch apps and navigate the TV's menus.-If you pair a Bluetooth speaker, every time you turn the TV on you have to wait for the TV to ask you if you want to connect to the speaker and then you have to press OK on the remote to connect. Just like in your car, the Bluetooth should connect automatically every time I turn the TV on, not ask me. It's the most annoying feature of the TV.",

    "Major hassle, could not get Amazon to work even though I am a prime member even though there was an app on the TV remote for prime it took me three hours with them having control of my TV I’m going to a supervisor to get it to work. was ready to return this TV!Also if you’re using the TV for Xfinity, the picture disappears for a split second every two minutes, nonstop it’s probably just meant to watch Netflix or Amazon. It’s very annoying.",

    "I selected this TV for: Apple TV compatibility, Samsung TV Plus, thin/light design. Unfortunately, the TV is stuck in soap opera mode.The 2 stars is mostly for customer service. I was the one training both the phone support and on-site technicians with online research. The technicians hadn't even heard of soap opera effect/motion smoothing.  I'll spare you the details of some of the troubleshooting conversations but I'm now reluctant to purchase Samsung in general. Returning the product unless someone knows of a fix outside of Picture Clarity and Judder Reduction settings (also tried unplugging, full reset, and tested all separate apps).Perhaps I should buy an older model, but first I'd like to verify there is no way to turn off soap opera.",

    "I like the variety available.",

    "Great picture. Lightweight. Don’t know about the sound quality, as I use a sound system with it.",

    "The screen was totally trashed when I received it.",

    "First one I got was broken but it was replaced after I did a return",

    "Very clear pic, and a great price. The only dislike is the remote. Very small and was confusing at first.",

    "Looks fantastic & we love it. No problems so far!",

    "This TV rules but after about a month and half of use there's a streak of black pixels across the screen.",

    "I like everything about this TV.",

    "There was only one way to go from my old TV, that was small and people were a strange shade of green.  This TV is like IMAX to me! Huge, clear picture that looks like I could walk into. LOVE it! Remote control could be improved,  like adding numbers and simplified.  But I'm loving this TV!",

    "Best TV I've ever owned. Very happy with my purchase.",

    "The picture is perfect once you get the settings to your liking.  But get a sound bar because the sound is a bit dull.",

    "Tried getting the issue resolved but the call got dropped. Tried several times. I will list a one star for all because the experience has tarnished all aspects of tv.",

    "Good Picture, Small Remote with only one button and a surrounding control ring. It isn't that intuitive to navigate and it's east to misplace. The picture does make up for the remote though.",

    "Very skinny.",

    "Ordering and Delivery:Looked at several 65 inch TVs in this price range (under $1100) and decided on this model. Shipping and delivery was super fast. Arranged a delivery date and time when ordering. They brought it up to my 3rd floor apartment and put the box inside my doorway.Packaging:The TV itself was smartly packaged. Just cut the banding and lift the box over the tv sitting in a base. It’s huge!The Television Itself:It’s a visually appealing television. It looks well made and expensive. Edges are minimal. Legs installed easily. Remote is small but I prefer a smaller remote. The smart function on this TV is awesome and easy to use. The Samsung software is fast. The picture is beautiful!Very happy with this purchase.",

    "Beautiful picture, clear & bright. Still getting used to it but loving the size (65') so hard to tear myself away sometimes because I just want to watch so much to test the quality.",

    "Does not work well with Sony Av Receiver. Must power up the receiver before the TV otherwise the TV goes into setup mode for several minutes unless you power cycle the TV again.",

    "El producto está dañado",

    "My cheaper Tv has a better picture.",

    "The picture quality is just beautiful, and my living room and my  animals are so happy.I'm back in the living room.. :-)",

    "Be careful.  It does not have MLB appThe only soundbar I was able to get to work with remote tv on/off and tv remote volume was Bose soundbar plugged into hdmi 2.",

    "It was small enough to fit under my loft bed without being overwhelmingly bright.  The picture can be tuned to be very clear and smooth. It's not a bad tv for the price.",

    "Only complaint is, it won’t synch with the sound bar I bought for it. But its own speakers are terrific",

    "I recently purchased this TV through Amazon. Upon opening the package, it was evident that the device was defective. Multiple pixels were messed up in one of the corners. The package is undamaged and appears to have been shipped carefully. Even with the visible defect, Samsung support will not take accountability for the issue and will not replace the TV, which is under warranty. I cannot emphasize enough how displeased I am with Samsung's service. I strongly recommend avoiding the company at all cost because they do not stand by their products. Their customer service is extremely poor and, if you ever receive a defective product like I did, they made it explicitly clear to me that they do not care and will not take any action to rectify the situation. I expected so much more from Samsung and am extremely disappointed.Update: While Samsung's customer service was useless, rude, and awful, Amazon's customer service immediately stepped in to address the situation. Even though the warranty on the device was directly through Samsung, Amazon still exchanged it after the return period ended. I am very thankful to Amazon for resolving this mess and demonstrating excellent customer service.",

    "Great TV.  Love all the smart features.  Easy to link with Samsung smart phone for casting.",

    "The picture quality is amazing and the size of the tv is wonderful!!!  We love being able to speak into the remote - so much easier then rolling through the guide!!  We are able to get all our streaming stations. Very easy to navigate - even for old folks like us!!!",

    "I like everything except the cloudy patches that are on the screen since I powered it up. Now, I need to decide if I do a return and exchange, or will the same thing happen on another one or worse. I'm torn and only have a few weeks left to return. UghUpdate: I contacted Samsung about the cloudy patches and chatted with an agent and uploaded my photos. They said it was a defect, and i could contact the seller for exchange. So I did.Amazon sent me a replacement, which although it was delayed a few days, finally arrived today. I just set up and it's perfect!!! I did it soon enough to still have time to return the 1st one without being charged. I opted to pay for UPS pickup, because I didn't want to go through the hassle of loading it into my car and driving it to a UPS store. So far, the pickup fee is only about $10.00.I was worried the second TV would have the same issues as the first and I'm very glad I went though the relatively quick and painless option to exchange it.Samsung, I'm still in love with you. 💜",

    "The Samsung TV has good picture quality and features; however, it is the only flat-panel TV that I've had any problems with within two years or less. The recurring issue that I have is that the fuses tend to fail. This issue is not the worst scenario; the problem lies in the fact that this seems to be a recurring issue with Samsung TVs, and there is no easy way to access the fuse or remove it conveniently.The entire rear back panel of the TV has to be removed, after which you will find that the fuse is soldered in place instead of the typical application of a fuse holder. This configuration leads me to believe this is a ploy on Samsung's behalf to encourage customers to purchase service or purchase an entire board which costs hundreds of dollars.",

    "I like this TV for multiple reasons. I play video games on a PS4 and they come across beautifully. It has a specific game mode and I love it. I got better at the games almost immediately. I find the picture quality is dependent on what app you are using as opposed to cable. I use a sports app through roku notorious for sucking and the quality represents that. When using other apps on the TV itself they are great looking. This is my first smart TV so I have nothing to compare it too personally but since I have a samsung phone and it can pair, I am happy so far. I do wish it had a dedicated sports mode but they still look great depending on the app you use.The remote they send you is very small and the voice doesn't hear you very good or respond very well at all either, easier to use your phone or other remotes, although it generally pairs without issue. Except for the roku stick I have and idk why, kind of annoying but whatever.It is like 10 pounds, so light, my cat is literally heavier and harder to lift. I love the picture e",

    "The TV came within three days of purchase. It has a beautiful picture, clear & sharp. It was easy to unpack & set up.",

    "Liked that the TV picture is great.",

    "Nice TV",

    "The 65in. has vibrant colors and very clear. Setup a bit Cumbersome but all in all not too complicated.You will need your passwords for things like Netflix, HBO Max etc",

    "The picture on this TV is INCREDIBLE! I would have loved it, if only they had taken the time to design a competent remote to go with the TV. We are completely unable to change the volume on the TV! After talking to samusung support we managed to turn it all the way down. Still can't turn it up. We will be working with them to get a new remote, assuming that one works. Perhaps I'll update this review if that works. Otherwise I'll be purchasing a universal remote and pitching this one in the garbage. Having volume keys that also control other functions is an example of COMPLETE STUPIDITYUPDATED REVIEWAfter “aggressive readjustment” AKA me throwing it into a wall the remote is actually working something must have broken loose because all the buttons work now. The volume button actually goes UP now, not just down. Don’t recommend my technique, but it worked!",

    "This TV has a great picture for an inexpensive model. The remote/OS takes a little getting used to, but at least you don't  need line of sight as it is wireless.",

    "You can't beat the combination of high end picture quality at an affordable price tag.",

    "Worked",

    "I am very happy with the TV and delivery process. Seems like a great product for the price.",

    "I read all the reviews and being a loyal Samsung user bought the 65 2021 model. Contrary to some reviews, the setup went smoothly (make sure you have 2 people so you don's damage when removing from packing box, setting on covered table for setup and for placing for final install. Followed the quick install directions but will admit that being a long time user of Samsung tv products I had an advantage and could anticipate any issues. Once it was turned on and paired with a Yamaha A203 sound bar and Base extension I was impressed with the picture quality. I will also admit here that my cable/internet connection through XFinity is amazingly fast with very high quality so the tv's performance really reflected the good input with beautiful output. I did virtually zero in adjusting any picture settings. I did move from Natural, Movie, etc multiple times to note differences, but that is about all. Now my negative: who ever thought up this remote should be buried in a mound of fire ants. I guess they tried to copy the Fire Stick remote but they failed. There is nothing here that is intuitive so after awhile of messing with it to move around the menus, sound, input selection etc. I picked up the remote from my 55 2017 model and was very happy to see that basically everything worked fine. Yeah, I know that now I have two remotes but I eliminated, for me, the fight in trying to learn something I don't like, Recommendation: but it you will like.",

    "Picture quality is real good",

    "Bought this for my dad  hes a happy camper  good tv soo far easy install ( mounted on the wall )",

    "This tv is soooooo slow. We have a tv from 10 years ago with a fire stick hooked up that runs better than this. Constant glitches. Super disappointed",

    "Excellent quality - excellent imageSoftware is faster than my previous one from another brand",

    "You do not need any other fire sticks or Apple TV because the apps are built in the TV",

    "When I saw this was a smart TV, I thought it would be compatible with Android apps- it is not. It's a Tizen TV despite not mentioning the word Tizen anywhere on the item page. Casting doesn't work with this TV, meaning almost every Android app with casting compatibility will not work with this TV (YouTube kind of functions as a poor remote). According to other reviewers, none of the other casting like apps work either. I own a Samsung phone and the best it can do is function as a slightly worse remote for the TV than the one included in the box.There's some awful thing called Samsung TV Plus that automatically plays whenever the TV is turned on. It uses your internet data to constantly stream advertisements to the TV. There are advertisements in the menus too. Samsung sells all of your usage information to 3rd party companies.The color quality is good, but I was buying this TV because I thought I could cast stuff from my phone to the big screen. Samsung really wants us to sign in to the apps in the TV so they have data to sell, the issue is how slow the whole thing is. There is so little RAM built into the TV that it struggles with the built-in keyboard. The apps are slow. The menus are slow. The experience of using this TV's UI is terrible.Don't buy it if you're looking for a smart TV.I will never buy a Samsung TV again.",

    "TV seems OK, but they require you to login to a Samsung account and give a name, birth date, and an email address that they verify.Added unnecessary hassle and aggravation to the setup process, but also they now have my email that they are going to do who knows what with.",

    "I have 2 other Samsung TVs that work flawlessly. I can't say the same for this one. When I turn on the TV the color is washed out so bad that people of color look pale. I can go to settings and select any mode and the color is good. When I turn it off the picture mode setting goes away.I have a subscription to MLB. TV and NFL Sunday ticket. Neither one of those apps is available on this TV. I wish I wasn't stuck with this TV and I certainly won't purchase another Samsung TV.",

    "About 6” from the left side of the 50” screen a black line appeared from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen.",

    "No input! No input on the remote... That was my very first issue. You see, I run a fire TV w/ a Sideclick. It was the end all be all 1 remote functionality that delivered on Fire TV, input, volume, mute & EQ.Fire TV was an issue at first, so I tried the Samsung software and it was slow and didn't have my apps.Right, I'm just going to give you a rundown of things:1. You need to buy a 5-in-1 4k 60Hz HDMI switcher2. You need to have an 8k (2.1 HDMI) cable connected to the output of the HDMI switcher. This is also a requirement for hooking up a PS5 or XBOX series X3. Note, Yeah this TV only has 60 Hz, so forget about 120Hz with the HDMI switcher4. Just disable the Smart TV in the menu5. You have to have the setting Input Signal Plus turned on6. Low Latency Game Mode must be turned off or else it puts everything at 1080p7. Fire TV setup - there is an issue with how the Samsung TV processes audio, so make sure your have Dolby Digital turned on and not PCM. PCM cause there to be clicking and you might think it's a hardware problem and order a new soundbar only to find out it's not the soundbar. This may also be a problem with consoles.8. I ended up using HDMI for my soundbar, but you can use optical (I wasn't a fan of the placement of the optical jack) ... I ran into an issue with the Fire TV and Bluetooth syncing from the turning of the TVLastly, after all that (2 weeks later in my case) when you have to turn on your TV, you have to turn it off and turn it on again as there is a bug that switches the TV picture to dynamic when it turns on the first time!It's all set up now. It looks great. Setup was a *&%!^ though.",

    "Best TV i've ever owned. Super easy to setup. The smart features are super cool. When you switch to Playstation on the source list, it starts the playstation up automatically. Same in the reverse order. If you switch your playstation on while watching tv, it will switch to source:playstation automatically. Lots more features as well. Very cool indeed.",

    "Terribly designed user controls and graphics make this TV all but unusable on its own. Plan on using an Amazon Stick or Roku device. Cannot remove many forced apps, cannot change order Samsung's apps (always in first place). No context menu button on remote??? Very bad design. When you navigate home, impossible to intuitively understand what is selected, see photo. Constantly pushed you to watch Samsungs TV Plus, which cannot be removed, reordered (it's always #1 in list), and plays by default under many situations. All in all, a very disappointing Samsung product!",

    "Great product, great picture, highly recommend.",

    "This TV lags consistently. If you don't watch the TV  consistently you consistently have to reconnect to Bluetooth. Very disappointed in this purchase as a Samsung branded product.",

    "This T.V. is great for a 4 K  Smart television.",

    "Send it back found a better price",

    "No one should purchase anything from Samsung they don’t want to fix what they manufactured. I’ll be spending my money on a LG before I get another Samsung product lesson learned after getting this tv",

    "If I could give a product zero stars I would. It fell off its own base and broke at 3am last night. PURE TRASH! Nearly landed on my dog too, never buying anything Samsung again.",

    "Picture is great and love all the added apps",

    "Very slick TV for a great price.  Picture is great and when mounted, TV is only just over an inch thick.  Very happy with the purchase and will be buying more!",

    "Great buy!!!!",

    "The price was good, but we weren't wowed by this TV set.",

    "Samsung’s Michelle and my Cable provider, Vincent worked simultaneously and effectively to get the BEST TV in the house operating",

    "I love all the free programming that comes with the TV. I wish the remote had number buttons etc. But that is the only thing to complain about. Very happy with Samsung. This is the second one I've purchased.  The 50in is perfect for my bedroom.",

    "All attributes are very good Except the Sound Quality. I have been using flat screens for years and am well aware of the challenges  with sound quality but this one is the worst I have ever had.",

    "The Alexa is glitchy, and the whole menu platform is too!It lags, the picture isn't great,  is confusing,  and just not what I expected from a Samsung product.I wish I just bought the LG for $200 less.",

    "I bought this Samsung tv about 21/2 - 3 years ago. The sound gets stuck, I can no longer get the sound to up or down without unplugging the tv and that doesn't work every time. Now it won't connect to the internet and when I try and factory reset it the keyboard won't show up so I cannot put in my password.  Bought my dad a 40 Samsung tv 2 years ago and his will no longer change channels. I would expect a tv to work longer then a few years. I will NEVER buy a Samsung TV again.  I would give zero stars if I could.",

    "After 40 days I no longer get any pictures with this Smart TV.It is a nightmare.I have LG and Vizio in the other rooms, and in 2 years neverchad an issue with them.Samsung only lasted 40 days",

    "If it wasn't for the constant creaking, this would be an excellent television. Unfortunately, this television creaks when it's off and creaks when it's on. It's extremely annoying. If it wasn't for the major undertaking it would be to repack this thing and my very limited free-time, I would return this creaking mess. It's about ready to go in the dumpster. I'll just have to live with spending close to $800.00 on such a disappointment.",

    "Their so called Smart Remote is anything but smart.  It has very few buttons, no numbers at all.  To change the channel of on-air channels, you have to click through all the channels in order.  Changing the aspect ratio requites 16-18 button clicks!  The picture is fine, but I hate the remote.",

    "This is an excellent TV at a decent price.  The picture is very nice and the TV seems to be up to Samsung quality standards.  The features are consistent w/past Samsung TV's, there are just more of them.  Setting the TV up was easy, it runs through a setup of all of the features.  Setting up the apps was easy as well.  It is a smart TV that came ready to install of the latest streaming apps.  The remote was easy to use. This TV is very thin and lightweight, which makes it easy for one person to handle.  This is the second Samsung television that we have in our home and I would consider buying a third if the need were to arise.",

    "Good setup for my bedroom. I currently use the built in Spectrum app so I can watch live TV.  Good upgrade from my old tv.",

    "Great video/picture quality but :1) no headphone jack at the back. can't use my wireless headphone with this TV.2) takes a while to navigate. I wish the menu system and remote is more user friendly.3) the antenna/F connector at the back is in a very tight space that I'm having problem connecting my  Monster antenna/F connector.",

    "Great tv",

    "I won’t waste my time writing a review for this tv. Do do buy it.",

    "Best TV I've ever had. Would definitely buy again.",

    "Worst buy ever. Shortly after buying the TV the volume goes out and cannot be adjusted by the remote for the TV. I bought this TV for my mother in another state and three days later she tells me the volume cannot be controlled and it stays up too high.",

    "i only use it for a computer monitor added a sound bar .great for my needs and the price was good.",

    "I usually push the electronics off to the young adults or guys in my family because I don’t want to sit there and debate picture ratio or wait for uploads and such.  This was quick, easy, and not heavy, so I was able to mount and get it working with Netflix, prime, pbs kids, etc pretty quickly.  My only complaint is that it is soooooo pretty (it has some screen saver things that come on at first), that nothing you watch after that is as beautiful.  I had no idea TVs could be this good.  Makes me want to spring for the silly super HD Netflix is now reeling me I need.  Gotta find some fancier things to watch because Daniel tiger in super HD still looks like Daniel tiger :0)",

    "This is a beautiful tv very slim has a great picture and a lot of features",

    "I highly recommend this  TV. The picture quality is amazing.  It is so colorful, crisp and clear. It was easy to setup and has great smart features.  The only issue I had was the sound quality. It was not good at all.. I expected  better from Samsung.  You have to turn the volume up to above 20 to hear it. So I had to buy a sound bar to actually hear.",

    "I was sad it was not a big as I thought; otherwise I like the TV. It actually measures 44 inches.",

    "Great picture.  I’m trying to get used to the other features.  However, I find the remote difficult to learn to use — it’s probably easier for younger people who are used to multiple functions of the same button.  Fortunately I mostly use the cable remote.",

    "The tv itself had been working fine but the remote only worked about 1 1/2 weeks. I am still dealing with Samsung  in order to get a new remote. Amazon connected me to samsung in a conference call and 1 hour later they said they would send a remote. I could not find an external turn on switch and Samsung told me this tv did not have one. A couple of days later my husband found one and I bought a universal remote but I need the Samsung remote in order to have Alexa and some of the other features for the smart tv.At this point I would only buy a tv from a local merchant in town,",

    "Amazing picture quality, super easy setup on my iPhone, simple remote control, great price AND installment purchase if you chose with Amazon, and did I mention an incredibly awesome display!!! Samsung keeps my loyalty once again!",

    "Work great",

    "Thanks to the pandemic, was lucky enough to get this before inflation started.  Got the X bracket on sale and saved over $80 to get it for a deserving Valentine’s Day gift.  Compared to the 60 inch Samsung in the living room, marginal utility of the 43 inch was accomplished by the difference in total cost to be $1300 to $436 plus $16 for bracket.  Easy installation with stud finder and a impact drill.  Only difference is 17 inches btw the two and & in price, a savings of $900.",

    "There’s absolutely nothing to dislike about this tv.",

    "Many features at a reasonable price for a 4k tvSimple to use and integrated alexa is nice to have feature",

    "Very clear picture. Great value!!!",

    "Bought the 65, unboxed it, just to find out the screws to my TV stand didn't fit it (naturally) and no mounting hardware came with the TV. For all the money this thing cost, they can't include some screws??",

    "I just love it!",

    "To add batteries had to pry open remote with a knife.  Other than that works fine so far...  Features a little slow to respond.",

    "So far, I am enjoying it.Wish the settings or source button were on remote instead of having to do a few maneuvers to change source.Also a little disappointed that no optical connection was available so I had to invest in HDMI splitter which is extra steps when changing sources.",

    "After 3 days of trying to get connected it became obvious that is was not user friendly!",

    "I’ve had this tv about a week and a half now and I couldn’t be happier. Picture quality is great and the sound is much better than I was expecting for a Tv so thin. I’ve used the various firesticks for years but with this TV I don’t really need it anymore with the smart features this comes with.",

    "Amazingly thin, very vivid picture and decent sound. The remote control is very easy to get used to and easy to use. Setup was a snap. The interface is very easy to use and the preloaded apps are perfect for me. I still have much to explore like using Alexa but navigating is so simple with the remote that I haven't seen the reason to use voice commands. With a dazzling picture and above average sound, this TV is well worth the money.",

    "The TV was damaged in shipping and I returned it to the supplier. The damage was to the picture and I could not even use the TV.",

    "Great smart tv. I use it on my patio in the evening to watch movies. With Bluetooth earbuds I don't disturb anyone.",

    "I thought this was gonna be the tv that helps me get rid of my devices (Apple TV and Fire TV) sadly I was mistaken. The quality between the stock Hulu apps and others versus the quality in my Apple TV is stark. The apps are clunky (especially Hulu) and slow to load on top of the quality being terrible.I have a 55 inch curved Samsung in my bedroom that is the stock apps are nowhere near as slow and bad quality as this is.If you can get the 65 inch for $500 and use your.smart device better picture do it!! Anything more hard pass.",

    "The samsung that i bought this one to replace was almost 10 years old and never gave me a problem once and i would have still had it but i dropped it cleaning around it. This one is a great size since the room isn't that large and its so simple to set up and works amazingly well with Alexa and all the apps. Good price good size good value. The remote is an improvement over the last series of remotes with samsung televisions. Its also about half the weight of the last one so i think it will be with me a long time.",

    "Is not what I expected, , this is not a 4K",

    "The support feet on this TV are only 43in wide. That is even less than my 55 in TV, which was 3 inches wider! My TV table is only 48 inches wide, and because of that most 65in TVs were too wide to be supported by my table.The TV was easy to set up, and came with a lot of new features, including Bluetooth! And most importantly, the picture quality is fantastic!",

    "Love this TV.  The setup is pretty extensive but won’t take more than 15 min.  The color and detail and animation speed are astounding for the price.  Very happy with my purchase!",

    "Web browser is slow and freezes constantly.  Called Samsung help support and they couldn’t figure it out snd just said “Samsung smart tv isn’t capable of handling heavy web content, flash or streaming.”  Doesn’t sound so “smart” to me.Now I have to return this and purchase an LG since that one doesn’t have any issues with browsing or streaming.Very disappointed and not likely to consider another Samsung tv.",

    "Apparently I need to register an account with a Google assistant in order to raise or lower the volume of my own TV. Yeah, I definitely need a dumb TV.",

    "With the TV overheating and the display being blurry, it is not worth the investment and the price.",

    "Love being able to see the television again, great quality! The only thing I have issue with is the sound, a little like coming from a box, but I don't hear well, could just be me. I'll be adding a sound bar.",

    "Lo recomiendoExelente tv lo esperado",

    "It took quite some time to set this TV up.Instructions not very clear.You really have to read what instructions you get especially for the remote.Also took awhile to pair my 4K Xfinity box and my Vizio sound bar.But once I got it all set up,it seems to be a really nice tv.It has a very good picture and the menu is good,once you get it set up.So far,so good.It could have a better remote and more clear instructions.",

    "( 75 inch AU8000 ) -  I will not let my initial experience with shipping take away from this product. THIS IS THE BEST TV OUT BEHIND SAMSUNGS QLED SERIES . The displays pigmentation is UNMATCHED.!!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ( Initial experience is below) beware of shipping but luckily Amazon has a great return policy they got my replacement tv  to me in 3 days and it’s perfect !..Only not 5 stars because it came damaged / with the tv screen cracked. If the tv comes how it’s supposed to and it has good quality I’ll fix this review but until then I’m very dissatisfied.",

    "If you enjoy movies and TV as much as my family and I do, then you will love this TV!  It's as if you're standing right next to the TV characters...they are so clear.  And the detail in the scenery is amazing too.  Took me a little while to get used to the way the TV works with the Samsung plus (it's our first smart TV - haha!).  Now I don't think I ever want to go back to a regular picture TV.  I'm very happy with this purhcase.  Well worth the price tag.",

    "The OS seems to freeze sometimes, and the TV does not seem to take all the inputs from the remote.",

    "works with alexa",

    "Clean sharp picture, solid blacks. Haven't used smart features. Remote is minimalist",

    "Bought the first tv and right out of the box there was a yellow sticker that I peeled off and underneath was a small bubble as seen in the picture.  Plus the TV is slow when I change Chanels on YouTube tv the tv locks up and I have to turn off and turn the unit back on. I ordered a replacement that arrived today and that one had two larger bubbles on the screen and almost noticeable scratches all over the screen.  The first one was in better condition. Returning the second one right away and not sure what I’ll do with the first one. This sucks never had issues purchasing a new tv before.",

    "Great picture quality, easy set up. The tv comes with all the streaming apps, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Prime and more. You can also install additional apps. The picture quality is awesome and the sound is great. This is a smart tv and it’s an easy set up if your smart, it’s not complicated. If you have a smart phone than setting up should be a breeze.",

    "Smart features seamless with samsung existing appliances.  Disappointed that there is no audio/video components connections for older devices, rendering them useless.",

    "Dislike small remote bigger one available?",

    "Avoid. Replaced our 9 year old broken 60 inch Samsung with this 65 inch and despite doing what we were told to do under settings turning full screen to on instead of auto most of the shows we want to stream end up cropped, which didn't happen on our old Samsung. So now most shows are 50 inch and squished despite buying a tv that is 5 inches bigger than our old one. Great. It would be swell if this came with a manual having to rely on the really annoying voice to walk you through set up or the online manual is cumbersome - you end up on YouTube instead. We quickly googled how to turn that really terrible voice off. Despite having a fast internet connection, it's very slow to load anything and glitches often. No warning your remote is low on battery so you spend a lot of time trying to figure out why the tv will turn on but won't work. And the remote isn't that intuitive to use either. Using a firestick isn't that easy since you can't plug it into the Xbox like we did with our old Samsung so spent a lot of time trying to figure out why it wouldn't recognize it so just plugged it into the tv instead but it is hard to get to. Picture quality is fine when it works. Going through returning this will not be fun. Our old Samsung was great and hard to believe after 9 years they did the opposite of improving it and could make something so awful.Update: now the sound won't play at all and after doing all the troubleshooting and even giving Samsung remote help access to the TV they still couldn't get the sound to play. No it wasn't on mute. Short of having to reset everything, which means any apps that have been downloaded would have to be downloaded again or any apps we've logged into we'd be logged out of and have to relog into again along with resetting settings to preferred settings all over again. And that's a unlikely to fix the issue I don't know why it would. And even if it did, how many times do you want to have to do something like that just to hear your tv?Update two: had a night's rest and the sound worked in the morning. Called Samsung support and they were stumped as to why. I noticed when attempting to find the button on the tv that allows you to control channel volume etc. that the tv was hot - likely from a few hours of gaming or just being on. It was allowed to cool over night and then worked. This is just a hypothesis but all other troubleshooting didn't work. Not something I feel like dealing with. AVOID.Update three: audio cut out again and couldn't turn up the volume using the remote or the tv. Called and turns out the a cold reboot is necessary if you switch ports (xbox, firestick, live samsung tv/smart hub.) After awhile if you switch sources a lot throughout the day the audio will time out. It's a flaw since how many people using game devices and things like roku or firestick etc? They need to fix this with a software fix or something what a pain. You have to press the power button for 10 seconds to do a cold reboot when turning the tv on.Update: decided to go for a replacement instead of a return. And while so far so good this one isn't having sound issues and they did get rid of the annoying autovoice, it is so slow to load channels for the samsung tv plus app. It often just doesn't work and don't even think about changing channels easily. And it did have a brief color issue where everything had a pink hue during a marvel movie in disney plus. If we have any issues we'll have to go through the inconvenience again of taking it off the wall and getting something else. They were willing to send someone out to fix because it is still under warranty but they did want to charge us to get it down off of the wall.",

    "I like that it automatically programs the remotes.  The picture quality is great along with the smart features.  The remote control guides you through the television programs.  Still learning!",

    "Sharp clear color. Easy to install on existing TV mount. I find the remote to be very frustrating. The goal seemed to have a very minimalist look to the remote. In which they did succeed. The instructions are very confusing, and there could be more buttons on it in order to not have multiple use buttons.",

    "Delivery was fast, and I haven't left the set up screen yet. However, I did notice this cluster of dead pixels on the lower left corner. I'm really bummed out.",

    "We purchased this tv last week, and it came in a day early. It arrived at 6:15AM (meaning someone was home which is great). It’s very slim and sleek. The picture quality is incredible. My husband and I have never purchased a tv together until now, so our two that we have been using are small and at least 9 years old. We haven’t ever had a smart tv so this was a big selling feature. Setup was easy, just have your phone (or computer) ready when you start set up. It took about 20 minutes to get everything set up and ready to go. We are most excited about only needing one remote. We can use our cable remote as well, but it isn’t necessary. We came from three so this is a big change. We highly recommend this tv, especially at such a great price. If anything changes, we will update.",

    "It's a great tv but the speakers on it aren't that good. I also tried to hook up my Samsung sound bar to it and it won't recognize it.",

    "Great picture, great apps",

    "Love the TV.  Great pictures and apps.  Do recommend a sound bar.",

    "Excellent picture quality, sound and features",

    "even I could have done it",

    "I have been buying Television s from 1960. This is the worst piece of trash I have ever wasted my money on. The remote is junk keeps taking you to other channels and you can not get out of them , and don’t buy the story that it works with Zlexa ? No!! I bought the fancy $39 smart plug and even Alexa gets confused, the volume is junk and sound terrible . If you get it to work you will need speakers",

    "Dead pixels on screen in some spots, audio quality not good but over all a nice tv",

    "The TV works excellently even though there was a lot of damage to the packaging from UPS (see pics). Kudos to the Samsung package designers and shipping department...  So far the TV performs well.",

    "Beautiful picture. Easy to set up",

    "Very good quality for my needs",

    "Great TV !",

    "Easy set up and looks great! The picture quality is very nice and the remote is easy to use! I had no problems setting up my direct tv genie. The Television basically walks you through!",

    "The picture on this TV is generally poor. I tried many, many changes to the settings. Even at its best, if looking at the TV from off-center, the colors are white-washed. I followed the advice of another owner and turned on Game Mode despite not gaming. It helps, but only from dead-center. I returned the TV after trying to adjust settings many many times with no consistent success.I do like most of the features. Using Alexa to set a sleep timer worked once but not since the first time. Setting a sleep timer with the remote involves many pushes due to where it is on the menu structure.",

    "Picture quality is amazing. The remote is smaller than the old one we had, and takes a little getting used to. We’ve paired it with a Bose sound system. Great combo.",

    "We love this tv. !!!  Would buy another.  Easy to set up and operate",

    "So far it’s awesome! Set up was easy peasy. Fantastic using only one remote. We had no problems whatsoever in set up.",

    "This new AU8000 was defective right out of the box. I bought this Samsung TV because my 7 1/2 year old Samsung 40 SHD not smart TV worked flawlessly since the day I got it, and it still does. But not this AU8000.The TV speakers are defective with a scratchy treble, flat midrange and almost absent bass end. By contrast, my old 40 TV has a clean rich sound to the TV speakers.The other problem with the AU8000 is that there was a severe audio-video lack of synchronicity on a few apps. That made watching impossible to enjoy. I spent a lot of time on the phone with Samsung tech support and despite their efforts, the problem was never resolved. It was a 3 week headache, so I returned the TV. Defective parts and software and I won't buy another at this point.And what is up with the lack of a headphone jack? Many people use headphones to not disturb others. And the Bluetooth included is useless, it's BT 4.2. BT for video needs to be 5.0, 5.1, or 5.2 with a low latency codec like AptX LL or Fast Stream low latency codecs.",

    "This TV has a very critically narrow field of view. Moving a few degrees off center causes immediate loss of color quality and sharpness.  Not at all what i expected from Samsung. Disappointing.",

    "Audio sync issue when using the apps from the tv and do not have a sound bar",

    "Poor sound for this price and size TV. Sounds like a 99.00 tv would sound. The picture is fabulous but I can’t get over the poor sound.",

    "Looks nice...but can't change the picture, or the audio..The remote is really hard to control..too many un-nessery buttons that don't do s--t .. Not a stero sound availabe....WOW !",

    "Love the picture clarity and smart features.",

    "I used to love Samsung tv’s but as I kept buying them I kept having numerous problems with them.  The issues are so bad at this point that I will never buy another one of their TVs again let alone a product of there’s. Truly a crappy product. I’d recommend getting LG, especially if your a gamer. Who wants to have their tv go black for 5 seconds at a time out of nowhere sporadically while playing something. Not me, can’t wait to never deal with Samsung ever again!!!",

    "The best television ever!!!!",

    "entrega muy cuidadosalinda mi tv grasias amazon",

    "Setting up this tv is NOT easy at all. The instructions are a joke! Switching from the pre loaded channels to cable is challenging to say the least. Sound is subpar, need a sound bar. Color is nice. It takes a whole lot of patience to set up and operate.",

    "Even with adapters this TV does not connect to a DVD or VCR! For some very odd reason unknown to all logical reason, it came with odd instructions to position the power cord in the opposite direction from ALL of the other cord connections, and it came with extra clipping parts for securing the power cord in the opposite direction, but they do not fit at all and do not work at all in securing the power cord connection. The directions show groves that are not present, and turn the power cord, so that the power cord is then positioned in a very wanky way so that it twists and turns back on itself instead of heading in a natural direction. I shouldn't have to use duct tape to protect the power cord. Seems to be a decent picture through seems rather dark. However, the cord connections are situated in a very poor design and the result will be added stress on the cords.",

    "I'm unable to review the Samsung TV because I received a 65 TCL Roku instead. I had help on the day to mount the tv on my wall so I didn't return the Roka. Feel cheated.",

    "There is a random barcode or something imprinted in the screen. It can’t be removed. Also they put a sticker on the TV screen which seems dumb. I regret buying this TV. If you don’t want to feel regret, buy another TV.",

    "Perfect size, easy set up and the sound quality is actually Great. I bought a sound bar but now I don’t think I need it.Oh and the Picture quality is superb!",

    "I went with this Samsung TV b/c of brand recognition and liking other Samsung products I've owned. This is the first Samsung TV I've purchased mainly b/c TVs used to last years however the smart TV this is replacing (a different brand) lasted about a year and a half.What I like about this TV is that it was simple to set up. The stands were straight forward no screw driver needed, it is fairly light so overall the setup was quick.While the app interface isn't very impressive the smart features are. I like the integration across devices. I do not have cable I stream or cast and being able to use my phone to log in or connect accounts was very convenient.The image on the tv is great, no complaints, HOWEVER at the upper right edge of the TV there is some breakthrough light. Not sure you can call it backlight bleeding b/c on darker backgrounds it isn't very noticeable. Have attached an image. Now I have questions: Is this typical? Will it get worse? And so as a result I'm unsure about keeping this unit.",

    "So far so good! Just received it today in a very timely manner and it looks immaculate! Super thin with a very sharp picture. Gotta get used to the interface I hope its pretty customizable because they do implement new concepts and functionality throughout the software. I will update in awhile to touch on the longevity. Peace!",

    "Bought our Samsung 65 TV on June1, 2021.  Called Samsung for service on June 25. TV constantly blacks in and out, sound goes off intermittently and sound is out of sink with person talking  when it does come on.  It is now July 2 and after 3 calls in 7 days we still have not had a date for a service person to come out and fix the problem.  Very disappointed in Samsung and their Asurion in-home service, and Amazon for selling a product we seem unable to get repaired.",

    "Set up was easy the tv automatically connected to the samsung soundbar and immediately recognized the wifi. I dont use all the smart features but the picture quality is amazing. I would recommend a soundbar because the volume isnt there i had to turn it pretty high to get good sound quality. I also live in a city and outside noise can cloud any audio. I have a tv from 2020 and the remote control is different the older one was accessible on amazon for under 10 bucks so hopefully the new one will be too.",

    "CalidadExcelente producto, fue enviado hasta panama, sin ningun daño",

    "Great TV for the price. Was worried about the refresh rate but have had no problems. The Bluetooth feature is nice when I want to watch TV next to my wife that has gone to sleep.",

    "remote not easy to use",

    "Pretty good in most aspects the speaker quality is not very good",

    "Difficult to set up to internet, not sure why. Very nice picture and good size for fireplace shelf",

    "Love the price (thanks Prime Day), love the size, love the viewing amenities, love the snap on legs.  Don't love that it has not audio set up to go with my Sony DVD/VHS player, don't love parts of the remote.  Like that the remote handles similar to an Apple TV remote but it's very touchy as some buttons are dual purpose and difficult to find the setup screen if you accidently activate say captions or voice options.  Had to consult YouTube for instructions because the instructions that were included are VERY limited.  More instructions were supplied on how to take it out of the box than how to set up or use the remote.",

    "Samsung never fails to impress me with their quality and features. Absolutely flawless TV with amazing abilities to stream 4K video over Wi-Fi without blurring or digital artifacts. It was super easy to attach the legs and get it set up.The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the remote control. Obviously Samsung is taking the minimalist approach. The remote is super thin and sleek with a very futuristic look. However, it doesn't have a lot of buttons, so sometimes it can be difficult to find the adjustment you would like to make.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this product.",

    "Arrived today and the color is spectacular. Features and apps are nonstop.",

    "I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. The picture quality is excellent.",

    "It’s in my living room Awsome sound thru my Sony recieved Awsome picture very happy with my new Samsung TV .",

    "If you use HDMI from your laptop you have to redetect PC EVERYTIME you startup or even come off of sleep. Very annoying several steps everytime you go away and come back later.",

    "We got this tv from Amazon-Best Buy and what a terrible experience setting it up. Everything is done on screen, no printed instructions, no tech support number provided. There is nothing standard about this. So we tried a basic Roku tv and it was all setup the usual way, a printed startup guide which also provided a tech support number and email. If you're into a non standard approach to setting things up then this Samsung might be for you, but watch out for the babbling robot.",

    "I am impressed with this tv picture. the sound from my surround sound through digital connection is life-like. I'm learning the smart tv and remote which are different from my past experience with fire-tv. So far very satisfied. I will revisit this review as time goes on. For now, very satisfied. Amazon delivery was on time, professional and accomodating. Coach",

    "I was not so sure to order Tv. Online and a little sceptical at first. Turn out this is very nice TV. We enjoy our evening after hot day in the aweful hot summer this year. Nice picture , great sound. We only been watching it for couple of days. Will see how long before we start see any problem. I will update if anything come up in the future but everything work perfect for now.",

    "Samsung tizen tv systems are designed to work with Android phones. Great picture, poor sound quality. Right leg was loose, it doesn't screw on and fell off when picking up tv. Even though Samsung sent a new leg it didn't fix the issue. Remote was a little hard to use",

    "Love it",

    "Save your money! The sound quality is TERRIBLE. Why are the speakers on the back of the TV?  I am not a gamer or big movie buff I simply want to watch TV. The sound is muffled like it’s stuck in a box. Very disappointed",

    "I purchased this product on prime day but I also have a newer Sony 4k tv and this one is a lot less quality, of picture, smart features and remote. I would not purchase again and if wasn't such a bear to send back I would do so... spend the money and get the sony....",

    "Just unboxed and set it up only to find a damaged panel displaying a white elliptical patch most prominent on a black screen / images with intense dark colors.Reached out to Amazon and asked for a replacement, hopefully that one doesn’t show up damaged like this one.",

    "I was ecstatic the moment I placed the order for this TV. I have an outdated 1080p TV and wanted to upgrade to 4K for gaming and movie experiences. So when I found out the new TV was coming a day earlier than anticipated I excitedly tracked it via the Amazon app all the way up until mere moments before the delivery truck arrived.I got the new TV, got it set up in its rightful place in my bedroom and went through the entire process of setting it up and signing into all of my favorite movie/tv apps. Its plentiful with apps, customizable and the screen mirroring (from an iPhone) function was fun. I also loved being able to give it voice commands via the remote. For those things I’ll grant an additional star.I’m only giving this TV two stars because of the immensely devastating picture quality. I spent literal hours - without moving - tinkering with absolutely every setting and Googling for troubleshooting purposes. My internet connection is totally fine.  Every cable and plug-in is also fine. There’s nothing “4K” about this TV at all. The picture is grainy and displeasing no matter whether you’re just watching regular TV, Netflix, Amazon, anything. I included a couple of pictures from Downton Abbey for proof and am also enclosing a picture from my old TV, which I just set back up. It’s pretty bad when a 6 year old 1080p TV trumps a supposed 4K television from 2021.I’ve returned for a refund.",

    "Bought 24 of these from a vendor. All 24 were bad. with dead pixels in the upper right hand corner and numerous had scuffs on the screen. Got in the replacement 24 tv's and they have the same issue with dead pixels and scuffs on the screen through the plastic protection. No damage on the outside of the box.",

    "Es un televisor de muy technologies y me Gustav muchoEstoy muy Feliz con mi televisor sus functions y images junto con el control y la function Alexa gracias",

    "The picture is so enveloping! Beautiful coloring and as you can see from my pics the side view ain't to shabby either .  It's SUPER light weight!! Wow! Now getting used to the remote and all the combined features could have been easier, its alot.  Not sure if I'll ever get it all understood but computer and phone both work on it nice and easy. Best bargain shopping success I've had in ever. Great tv",

    "picture quality is excellent..",

    "I don't usually leave negative reviews but because of thesmart features this tv is not worth it. Most TV are easy to setup but this one goes behind you and reset your settings.",

    "The picture is good. The sound is poor.20 sounds the same 53.  The remote is small but difficult to operate and turn up the volume compared to spectrums remote.",

    "Some scenes look like real life outside a window. Remarkable clarity.",

    "Good picture, but has some issues while running apps. Mostly just YouTubetv.",

    "The picture, the colors are amazing!! But the sound is not good, from 1 to 100 or average is 75 and you think that would be very loud but it’s not!!! So hopefully Amazon prime will have some sound bars on sale!! Remote control is super tiny but thank God we don’t have to use it!!",

    "So easy to set up and the picture is like being at a movie theater.",

    "Easy to prepare this product for service.  Instructions that come with the set could be better and easier to understand.  Only one negative situation: The on/off audio notification is quite loud.  Tried to get help with that and it seems that is just the way it is made. If you mute the sound prior to shutting the T.V. the off notification sound is disabled.  Advisable if someone is in the room is asleep as it will startle and wake them up.  Otherwise very nice.",

    "I have a four year old 43mu630dfxza Samsung that has a well documented Sound problem. The control freezes and the only means of temporary recovery is unplug for a time. This is suppose to be premium company but obviously I am in the situation with all the owners of this TV, It will have to be replaced and probably soon I will not be able to get sound at all. Obviously I will not buy Samsung. Fool me shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!!!",

    "Fantastic quality for the price. I am using them as gaming monitors. They are absolutely worth the money though be warned if you buy more than one and they are in the same room the remotes will interfere with other TVs of the same brand.  You are better to use the app on your phone so you don’t shut off both TVs at the same time. I have 3 Samsung TVs in my room and I don’t even use the remotes because one remote controls all 3 TVs and will turn one tv on and turn others off even when you don’t point the remote at that tv.",

    "It took me a while to realize that I had to turn the gaming mode on (even though I don't use it for gaming). Once that setting was changed, the picture became perfect. The other small tweak was that I purchased a wireless sound bar. I put the sound bar on the floor in an inconspicuous space (under a desk). Now, the sound and picture are both perfect.",

    "Great tv. Excellent color",

    "Screen is crisp and clear. All controls are laggy and don’t respond to the first touch of the remote. This is my second replacement as the first ones screen was damaged.MUCH happier with my LG.",

    "Works awesome",

    "Sad our Sanyo started to die, so we bought this, picture is OK, sound has a terribly tinny sound.Our Sanyo is 14 years old & still better than this",

    "First time buying a tv and had a terrible experience. Right out the box the TV looked to have been refurbished, because on the bottom right side of the screen there was some sticky residue on the screen which might have come from some sort of sticker that was placed on it (display TV?) while the top left corner of the screen had what looked like an upside “D” as dead pixels. Very disappointed and dissatisfied. Have to waste my time shipping it back, waiting for my refund to process, purchasing a new one, then waiting another couple days for that one to come in and hope it’s not broken!",

    "Outstanding tv. Great sound, even better picture.",

    "only downside is that it does not support Dolby vison",

    "good",

    "Be aware this isn't an Android TV",

    "Using this as a monitor and TV. Picked up on my Samsung sound bar immediately. Able to connect (wireless) from my surface book 3 and see it as an external monitor in 4k. Downloaded power toys from windows and set it up with fancy zones so it looks like the equivalent of 6 separate screens and you can lay the grid out however you like. Originally ordered a 65 curved screen but it arrived with some issues and I had to return it. Really wanted another curved screen but they were out of stock so I settled (so I thought) for the flat 65. This thing is a third of the weight, about a quarter of the thickness, and the screen is beautiful. Actually glad the other screen had the issues or I would never have ordered this model that I like so much better. Only issue I had was that when the delivery guys opened the door on the truck, the TV was laying over on top of some other boxes in the delivery truck with none of the other items in the truck secured in any way. I was advised that it had just fell over between this stop and the last. The guys were trying to pick it up from one end and there was a very noticeable amount of flex due to the way they were trying to maneuver it. I get it, I've worked delivery. These guys just wanted it off their truck so they could get to the next stop. That being said, when I worked delivery, I would NEVER have let the customer see me handling something they just paid over $850 for in the manner they were. I voiced my concerns and was told, it's ok, if it's damaged you can just return it. Come on, guys. At least act like you care about the item you're delivering.",

    "Great TV with excellent picture for the price. Smart features with most tvs (apps) are lame and not really an exception here. You will want a Fire stick or other option if you want to stream. The remote feature lets you control a fire stick with the TV's remote, which is pretty cool.",

    "Had this for about 2 weeks now and the picture quality looks amazing. Sound is what you’d most expect out of a flatscreen TV but it’s not bad either. It’s very easy to setup and has a lot of great smart features. The software has been a little bit delayed at times, but a majority of the time it’s smooth and easy to navigate with the remote control. Also, the picture is very clear and sharp with gaming & movies. Overall I would definitely recommend this TV for someone looking for a newer model within a cheaper budget.",

    "Screen Share/Apple AirPlay Does Not Work.  After two factory resets and numerous attempts to use the screen sharing/Apple Airplay functionality, we continued to get message on the TV “Unable to connect to Samsung Server.”  Everything else streamed and functioned great and internet connection fine.  Finally called Samsung Support, and after an hour on the phone, doing various resets and checks, I was told there was issue with the TV and I should return it."
